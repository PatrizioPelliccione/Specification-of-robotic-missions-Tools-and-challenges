\section{Subject Environments - RQ1}\label{sec:environments}

\tabref{tablelist} lists the environments that we have identified.
For each environment the table reports  
(i) the version that has been considered in this study;
(ii) whether the environments are designed for desktop computers,
mobile devices or are web based;
(iii) the mobile robot that is supported and its manufacturer;
(iv) whether the information reported in this study has been obtained by installing and using the tool, by using the web interface or by consulting the documentation.
 
%\claudio{Update the caption of the table to be a bit more specific}

%\deleted[id=CM]{Some environments were installed (I), others are web based (W) while in other we relied on documentation (D) either as a website, technical documentation or publications about the environments. For environments which are not web based and were not installed, compatibility of software and software policy were  the main reasons for not installing them.}

%\tb{Swaib, can you write a summary about the environments? (not much more than half a page); the original text is commented out below in the Latex file}
%\tb{is there a difference between block-based and blockly-based?} \swaib{blockly-based is an instance of block-based. Block-based means use of graph blocks/icons to represent programming concepts}

\tb{this section still has too many writing and grammar mistakes, Swaib, can you do a pass?}
