We propose a design of a web based programming interface that makes it possible for end-users with different backgrounds to program robots using natural language. We used the cognitive dimensions framework to compare the usability of the newly created and the currently employed programming interfaces. The results showed that domain specialists are able to make robot programs more quickly and pleasantly with the proposed interface than with an existing one. Another important finding is that without physical simulation of the robot behaviours, the end-users do not feel confident enough to develop their scenarios in a realistic setting.},

abstract = {Robotic Development Environments (RDEs) have come to play an increasingly important role in robotics research in general, and for the development of architectures for mobile robots in particular. Yet, no systematic evaluation of available RDEs has been performed; establishing a comprehensive list of evaluation criteria targeted at robotics applications is desirable that can subsequently be used to compare their strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, there are no practical evaluations of the usability and impact of a large selection of RDEs that provides researchers with the information necessary to select an RDE most suited to their needs, nor identifies trends in RDE research that suggest directions for future RDE development. This survey addresses the above by selecting and describing nine open source, freely available RDEs for mobile robots, evaluating and comparing them from various points of view. First, based on previous work concerning agent systems, a conceptual framework of four broad categories is established, encompassing the characteristics and capabilities that an RDE supports. Then, a practical evaluation of RDE usability in designing, implementing, and executing robot architectures is presented. Finally, the impact of specific RDEs on the field of robotics is addressed by providing a list of published applications and research projects that give concrete examples of areas in which systems have been used. The comprehensive evaluation and comparison of the nine RDEs concludes with suggestions of how to use the results of this survey and a brief discussion of future trends in RDE design.},

We identify the main PbD techniques, such as demonstrations through manipulation of the body of the learner robot or a model of the robot, demonstrations through the body motions of a human o robot teacher, demonstrations through the behavior of an object, among others. The paper also identifies the programming techniques that allow non-programmers to create a robot program easily. Furthermore, we present research opportunities of intuitive robot programming in an educational context. Currently, the scope and impact of robot-based activities have primarily focused on the teaching and learning of technical subjects. In this paper, we discuss some characteristics that robot programming environments should have to facilitate the integration of educational robotics in the learning and teaching processes of non-technical school subjects.},

abstract = {We propose ASEBA, a modular architecture for event-based control of complex robots. ASEBA runs scripts inside virtual machines on self-contained sensor and actuator nodes. This distributes processing with no loss of versatility and provides several benefits. The closeness to the hardware allows fast reactivity to environmental stimuli. The exploitation of peripheral processing power to filter raw data offloads any central computer and thus allows the integration of a large number of peripherals. Due to scriptable and plug-and-play modules, ASEBA provides instant compilation and real-time monitoring and debugging of the behavior of the robots. Our results show that ASEBA improves the performance of the behavior with respect to other architectures. For instance, doing obstacle avoidance on the marXbot robot consumes two orders of magnitude less bandwidth than using a polling-based architecture. Moreover, latency is reduced by a factor of two to three. Our results also show how ASEBA enables advanced behavior in demanding environments using a complex robot, such as the handbot robot climbing a shelf to retrieve a book.},

abstract="The design, simulation and programming of robotics systems is challenging as expertise from multiple domains needs to be integrated conceptually and technically. Domain-specific modeling promises an efficient and flexible concept for developing robotics applications that copes with this challenge. It allows to raise the level of abstraction through the use of specific concepts that are closer to the respective domain concerns and easier to understand and validate. Furthermore, it focuses on increasing the level of automation, e.g. through code generation, to bridge the gap between the modeling and the implementation levels and to improve the efficiency and quality of the software development process. Within this contribution, we survey the literature available on domain-specific (modeling) languages in robotics required to realize a state-of-the-art real-world example from the RoboCup@Work competition. We classify 41 publications in the field as reference for potential DSL users. Furthermore, we analyze these contributions from a DSL-engineering viewpoint and discuss quantitative and qualitative aspects such as the methods and tools used for DSL implementation as well as their documentation status and platform integration. Finally, we conclude with some recommendations for discussion in the robotics programming and simulation community based on the insights gained with this survey.",

In 2008, the world price of oil reached record highs after being adjusted for inflation, continuing a pattern of price increases over sev- eral years. Petroleum products derived from conventional crude oil constitute more than 50 percent of end-use energy deliveries in the United States and more than 95 percent of all energy used in the U.S. transportation sector. Emissions from the consumption of petroleum account for 44 percent of the nations CO2 Both the price of petroleum motor fuels and concerns regarding emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2 emissions resulting from transportation-fuel use (EIA, 2007a). Commonly considered alterna- tive transportation-fuel options for the near and medium terms (roughly 1020 years) include both biomass-based fuels (e.g., ethanol, biodiesel) and unconventional fossil-based liquid fuels derived from such sources as heavy oils, oil sands, oil shale, and coal liquefaction. In this report, RAND researchers assess the potential future production levels, produc- are driving attention to possible substitutes. In 2008, the world price of oil reached emissions, with approximately 33 percent of national CO2 tion costs, greenhouse gases (GHGs), and other environmental implications of synthetic crude oil (SCO) produced from oil sands and transportation fuels produced via coal liquefaction (often referred to as coal-to-liquids CTL). Production of liquid fuels from a combination of coal and biomass is also considered. Although oil shale is also an important potential uncon- ventional fossil resource, we do not address it in this report because fundamental uncertainty remains about the technology that could ultimately be used for large-scale extraction, as well as about its cost and environmental implications. Te omission from this report of renewable fuel options and other propulsion technologies should not be interpreted as a conclusion that the fossil-based options are superior to others.1},

This inability stems from delivery of 'stove-piped' capabilities to meet urgent operational requirements, use of proprietary software, and bandwidth/payload constraints. This paper explains the use of a data-centric solution to improve information sharing through use of (1) a widely available translation language (eXtensible Markup Language (XML)) and, (2) a consistent implementation framework provided for within the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM). The paper also describes a recent collaborative simulation event called the Simulated Interactive Robotic Initiative (SIRI).

abstract = {Middlewares are fundamental tools for progress in research and applications in robotics. They enable the integration of multiple heterogeneous sensing and actuation devices, as well as providing general purpose modules for key robotics functions (kinematics, navigation, planning). However, no existing middleware yet provides a complete set of functionalities for all robotics applications, and many robots may need to rely on more than one framework. This paper focuses on the interoperability between two of the most prevalent middleware in robotics: YARP and ROS. Interoperability between middlewares should ideally allow users to execute existing software without the necessity of: (i) changing the existing code, and (ii) writing hand-coded ``bridges'' for each use-case. We propose a framework enabling the communication between existing YARP modules and ROS nodes for robotics applications in an automated way. Our approach generates the ``bridging gap'' code from a configuration file, connecting YARP ports and ROS topics through code-generated YARP Bottles. {\%} {\%}The configuration file must describe: (i) the sender entities, (ii) the way to group and convert the information read from the sender, (iii) the structure of the output message and (iv) the receiving entity. Our choice for the many inputs to one output is the most common use-case in robotics applications, where examples include filtering, decision making and visualization. {\%} We support YARP/ROS and ROS/YARP sender/receiver configurations, which are demonstrated in a humanoid on wheels robot that uses YARP for upper body motor control and visual perception, and ROS for mobile base control and navigation algorithms.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Qualitative simulation is a well-known reasoning technique that involves the use of simulation technologies. Reasoning is made to determine qualitative values and change directions of system variables, and it is done for each time point and time interval following the time point. Qualitative variables possess continuous qualitative value sets that are discretized by landmark points. Qualitative simulation uses qualitative time representation and its quantitative value is of no interest. The main purpose of this study was to develop a technique to determine time steps for a quantitative simulation under guidance of qualitative information. The proposed technique determined time advances using qualitative and quantitative information together to obtain a robust time step as wide as possible for simulation time advances. For this purpose, sign algebraic properties and derivation roots of quantitative equations and qualitative variable values with their change directions were used to compute time advances. In the approach, qualitative simulation determined landmark points to be advanced, and quantitative simulation calculated the duration required. Using the proposed algorithm, the simulation is advanced instead of iterating simulation time for a predefined time step and checking whether or not there is any activity in the interval, directly to the time points that are qualitatively different.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Risk and feasibility are major factors supporting the use of unmanned craft and the use of automation and robotic technologies where possible. Autonomy in space helps to increase the amount of science data returned from missions, perform new science, and reduce mission costs. Elicitation and expression of autonomy requirements is one of the most significant challenges the autonomous spacecraft engineers need to overcome today. This book discusses the Autonomy Requirements Engineering (ARE) approach, intended to help software engineers properly elicit, express, verify, and validate autonomy requirements. Moreover, a comprehensive state-of-the-art of software engineering for aerospace is presented to outline the problems handled by ARE along with a proof-of-concept case study on the ESA's BepiColombo Mission demonstrating the ARE's ability to handle autonomy requirements.

abstract = {Target detection and tracking encompasses a variety of decisional problems such as coverage, surveil-lance, search, patrolling, observing and pursuit-evasion along with others. These problems are studied by several communi-ties, that tackle them using diverse formulations, hypotheses and approaches. This variety and the fact that target related robotics problems are pertinent for a large spectrum of appli-cations has motivated a large amount of contributions, which have mostly been surveyed according to one or another view-point. In this article, our objective is to go beyond the frontiers of specific communities and specific problems, and to enlarge the scope of prior surveys. We define classes of missions and problems, and relate the results from various communities according to a unifying taxonomy. We review various work related to each class of problems identified in the taxonomy, highlighting the different approaches, models and results. Finally, we propose a transverse synthesis which analyses the approaches, models and lacks that are recurrent through all the tackled problems, and isolate the current main research directions.},

abstract = {During last decade the scientific research on Unmanned Aerial Vehicless (UAVs) increased spectacularly and led to the design of multiple types of aerial platforms. The major challenge today is the development of autonomously operating aerial agents capable of completing missions independently of human interaction. To this extent, visual sens-ing techniques have been integrated in the control pipeline of the UAVs in order to enhance their nav-igation and guidance skills. The aim of this article is to present a comprehensive literature review on vision based applications for UAVs focusing mainly on current developments and trends. These applica-tions are sorted in different categories according to the research topics among various research groups. More specifically vision based position-attitude con-trol, pose estimation and mapping, obstacle detection as well as target tracking are the identified compo-nents towards autonomous agents. Aerial platforms could reach greater level of autonomy by integrating all these technologies onboard. Additionally, through-out this article the concept of fusion multiple sensors is highlighted, while an overview on the challenges},

UAV swarms pose several human factors challenges, such as high cognitive demands, non-intuitive behavior, and serious consequences for errors. This article presents findings from a meta-analysis of 27 UAV swarm management papers focused on the human-system interface and human factors concerns, providing an overview of the advantages, challenges, and limitations of current UAV management interfaces, as well as information on how these interfaces are currently evaluated. In general allowing user and mission-specific customization to user interfaces and raising the swarm's level of autonomy to reduce operator cognitive workload are beneficial and improve situation awareness (SA). It is clear more research is needed in this rapidly evolving field.},

@article{Nordmann2016a,
abstract = {—The development of advanced robotic systems is challenging as expertise from multiple domains needs to be integrated conceptually and technically. Model-driven engineering promises an efficient and flexible approach for developing robotics applications that copes with this challenge. Domain-specific modeling allows to describe robotics concerns with concepts and notations closer to the respective problem domain. This raises the level of abstraction and results in models that are easier to understand and validate. Furthermore, model-driven engineering allows to increase the level of automation, e.g., through code generation, and to bridge the gap between modeling and implementation. The anticipated results are improved efficiency and quality of the robotics systems engineering process. Within this contribution, we survey the available literature on domain-specific modeling and languages that target core robotics concerns. In total 137 publications were identified that comply with a set of defined criteria, which we consider essential for contributions in this field. With the presented survey, we provide an overview on the state-of-the-art of domain-specific modeling approaches in robotics. The surveyed publications are investigated from the perspective of users and developers of model-based approaches in robotics along a set of quantitative and qualitative research questions. The presented quantitative analysis clearly indicates the rising popularity of applying domain-specific modeling approaches to robotics in the academic community. Beyond this statistical analysis, we map the selected publications to a defined set of robotics subdomains and introduce an extended classification scheme to allow a fine-grained mapping of publications addressing the architecture and programming of robotics systems. We map the surveyed publications to typical development phases in robotic systems engineering. The resulting classification tree shall serve as overview and reference for potential users. Furthermore, we analyze the surveyed contributions from a language engineering viewpoint and discuss aspects such as the methods and tools used for their implementation as well as their documentation status, platform integration, typical use cases and the evaluation strategies used for validation of the proposed approaches. Finally, we conclude with recommendations for discussion in the model-driven engineering and robotics community based on the insights gained in this survey.},

@article{SerranoRodriguez,
abstract = {Nowadays, a major challenge in the development of advanced robotic systems is the creation of complex missions for groups of robots, with two main restrictions: complex programming activities not needed and the mission configuration time should be short (e.g. Urban Search And Rescue). With these ideas in mind, we analysed several robotic development environments, such as Robot Operating System (ROS), Open Robot Control Software (OROCOS), MissionLab, Carnegie Mellon Robot Navigation Toolkit (CARMEN) and Player/Stage, which are helpful when creating autonomous robots. MissionLab provides high-level features (automatic mission creation, code generation) and a graphical mission editor that are unavailable in other significant robotic development environments. It has however some weaknesses regarding its map-based capabilities. Creating, managing and taking advantage of maps for localization and navigation tasks are among CARMEN's most significant features. This fact makes the integration of MissionLab with CARMEN both possible and interesting. This article describes the resulting robotic development environment, which makes it possible to work with several robots, and makes use of their map-based navigation capabilities. It will be shown that the proposed platform solves the proposed goal, that is, it simplifies the programmer's job when developing control software for robot teams, and it further facilitates multi-robot deployment task in mission-critical situations.},

A study based on data from Qt and Ubuntu, highlights a high precision (90{\%}) and recall (70{\%}) of DECA in classifying email content, outperforming traditional machine learning strategies. Moreover, we successfully used DECA for re-documenting source code of Eclipse and Lucene, improving the recall, while keeping high precision, of a previous approach based on ad-hoc heuristics.},

abstract = {Our growing dependence on increasingly complex computer and software systems necessitates the development of formalisms, techniques, and tools for assessing functional properties of these systems. One such technique that has emerged in the last twenty years is model checking, which systematically (and automatically) checks whether a model of a given system satisfies a desired property such as deadlock freedom, invariants, or request-response properties. This automated technique for verification and debugging has developed into a mature and widely used approach with many applications. Principles of Model Checking offers a comprehensive introduction to model checking that is not only a text suitable for classroom use but also a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners in the field. The book begins with the basic principles for modeling concurrent and communicating systems, introduces different classes of properties (including safety and liveness), presents the notion of fairness, and provides automata- based algorithms for these properties. It introduces the temporal logics LTL and CTL, compares them, and covers algorithms for verifying these logics, discussing real-time systems as well as systems subject to random phenomena. Separate chapters treat such efficiency-improving techniques as abstraction and symbolic manipulation. The book includes an extensive set of examples (most of which run through several chapters) and a complete set of basic results accompanied by detailed proofs. Each chapter concludes with a summary, bibliographic notes, and an extensive list of exercises of both practical and theoretical nature.},

This paper describes the current state of the art in methodologies to enable long range AUVs and provides a detailed literature review of some existing AUVs characterizing their operation endurance. Path planning is identified as the core and crucial components to improve AUV persistence. The aims of path optimization, path re-planning adapting to the dynamic environments, and cooperative path planning of multiple AUVs have received much attention from the research community. This paper presents a review of the main research works focusing on these three technology areas. The main objective of this paper is to present a comprehensive survey of shape and properties of the path and optimization techniques for path planning. These techniques and algorithms have been classified into different classes and their assumptions and drawbacks have been discussed. Finally, the paper discusses the AUV literature in general and highlights challenges that need to be addressed in developing AUVs with advanced autonomy and capable of operating for longer mission durations.},

The following five deliberation functions are identified and analyzed: planning, acting, monitoring, observing, and learning. The paper introduces a global perspective on these deliberation functions and discusses their main characteristics, design choices and constraints. The reviewed contributions are discussed with respect to this perspective. The survey focuses as much as possible on papers with a clear robotics content and with a concern on integrating several deliberation functions.},

abstract = {Planners for real robotic systems should not only reason about abstract actions, but also about aspects related to physical execution such as kinematics and geometry. We present an approach to hybrid task and motion planning, in which state-based forward-chaining task planning is tightly coupled with motion planning and other forms of geometric reasoning. Our approach is centered around the problem of geometric backtracking that arises in hybrid task and motion planning: in order to satisfy the geometric preconditions of the current action, a planner may need to reconsider geometric choices, such as grasps and poses, that were made for previous actions. Geometric backtracking is a necessary condition for completeness, but it may lead to a dramatic computational explosion due to the large size of the space of geometric states. We explore two avenues to deal with this issue: the use of heuristics based on different geometric conditions to guide the search, and the use of geometric constraints to prune the search space. We empirically evaluate these different approaches, and demonstrate that they improve the performance of hybrid task and motion planning. We demonstrate our hybrid planning approach in two domains: a real, humanoid robotic platform, the DLR Justin robot, performing object manipulation tasks; and a simulated autonomous forklift operating in a warehouse.},

abstract = {We propose a hierarchical planning framework for mission planning and execution in uncertain and dynamic environments. We consider missions that involve motion planning in large, cluttered environments, trading off mission objectives while satisfying logical/spatial/temporal constraints. Our framework enables the decomposition of the planning problem across different layers, leveraging the difference in spatial and temporal scales of the mission objectives. We show that this framework facilitates contingency management under unanticipated events. Interaction between the various layers requires consistent model abstractions and common message semantics. To satisfy these requirements, we adopt a generic knowledge-based architecture that is independent from a specific application domain. We show a specific instance of our framework using a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) planner at the higher level and a Multi-Objective Probabilistic Roadmap (MO-PRM) planner at the lower level. The resulting planning system is tested in a realistic scenario where an agent is tasked with a mission in a large urban threat rich environment under dynamic uncertain conditions. The mission specification includes a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula that defines the desired behaviors, a list of metrics to be optimized and a list of constraints on time, resources and probability of mission success.},

abstract = {Specifying a reactive behavioral configuration for use by a multiagent team requires both a careful choice of the behavior set and the creation of a temporal chain of behaviors which executes the mission. This difficult task is simplified by applying an object-oriented approach to the design of the mission using a construction called an assemblage and a methodology called temporal sequencing. The assemblage construct allows building high level primitives which provide abstractions for the designer. Assemblages consist of groups of basic behaviors and coordination mechanisms that allow the group to be treated as a new coherent behavior. Upon instantiation, the assemblage is parameterized based on the specific mission requirements. Assemblages can be re-parameterized and used in other states within a mission or archived as high level primitives for use in subsequent projects. Temporal sequencing partitions the mission into discrete operating states with perceptual triggers causing transitions between those states. Several smaller independent configurations (assemblages) can then be created which each implement one state. The Societal Agent theory is presented as a basis for constructions of this form. The Configuration Description Language ({\{}CDL){\}} is developed to capture the recursive composition of configurations in an architecture- and robot-independent fashion. The {\{}MissionLab{\}} system, an implementation based on {\{}CDL{\}}, supports the graphical construction of configurations using a visual editor. Various multiagent missions are demonstrated in simulation and on our Denning robots using these tools.},

abstract = {As part of our research for the ARL MAST CTA (Collaborative Technology Alliance) [1], we present an integrated architecture that facilitates the design of microautonomous robot platforms and missions, starting from initial design conception to actual deployment. The framework consists of four major components: design tools, mission-specification system (MissionLab), case-based reasoning system (CBR Expert), and a simulation environment (USARSim). The designer begins by using design tools to generate a space of missions, taking broad mission-specific objectives into account. For example, in a multi-robot reconnaissance task, the parameters varied include the number of robots used, mobility capabilities (e.g. maximum speeds), and sensor capabilities. The design tools are used to intelligently carve out the space of all possible parameter combinations to produce a smaller set of mission configurations. Quantitative assessment of this design space is then performed in simulation to determine which particular configuration would yield an effective team before actual deployment. MissionLab, a mission-specification platform, is used to incorporate the input parameters, generate the underlying robot missions, and control the robots in simulation. It also provides logging mechanisms to measure a range of quantitative performance metrics, such as mission completion rates, resource utilization, and time to completion, which are then used to determine the best configuration for a particular mission. These metrics can also provide guidance for the refinement of the entire design process. Finally, a case-based reasoning system allows users to maximize successful deployment of the robots by retrieving proven configurations and determine the robot capabilities necessary for success in a particular mission.},

This is particularly important for empirical research where there is often a multitude of possible threats. With a growing focus on empirical research methods in software engineering it is important that there is a consensus in the community on this importance, that validity analysis is done by every researcher and that there is common terminology and support on how to do and report it. Even though there are previous relevant results they have primarily focused on quan-titative research methods and in particular experiments. Here we look at the existing advice and guidelines and then perform a review of 43 papers published in the ESEM conference in 2009 and analyse the validity analysis they include and which threats and strategies for overcoming them that were given by the authors. Based on this analysis we then discuss what is working well and less well in validity analysis of empirical software engineering research and present recommendations on how to better support validity analysis in the future.},

Such analysis has, however, merits for researchers and practitioners as well.In this chapter, we describe the basics of analyzing text in software projects. We first describe how to manually analyze and code textual data. Next, we give an overview of mixed methods for automatic text analysis, including n-grams and clone detection, as well as more sophisticated natural language processing identifying syntax and contexts of words. Those methods and tools are of critical importance to aid in the challenges associated with today's huge amounts of textual data.We illustrate the methods introduced via a running example and conclude by presenting two industrial studies.},

Many software organisations have embedded au-tomatic crash reporting tools in their software systems to help development teams track and fix crash-related bugs. Previous techniques, which focus on the triaging of crash-types and crash-related bugs, can help software practitioners increase their debugging efficiency on crashes. But, these techniques can only be applied after the crashes occurred and already affected a large population of users. To help software organisations detect and address crash-prone code early, we conduct a case study of commits that would lead to crashes, called " crash-inducing commits " , in Mozilla Firefox. We found that crash-inducing commits are often submit-ted by developers with less experience. Developers perform more addition and deletion of lines of code in crash-inducing commits. We built predictive models to help software prac-titioners detect and fix crash-prone bugs early on. Our pre-dictive models achieve a precision of 61.4{\%} and a recall of 95.0{\%}. Software organisations can use our proposed predic-tive models to track and fix crash-prone commits early on before they negatively impact users; increasing bug fixing efficiency and user-perceived quality.},

abstract = {The concept of design thinking (DT) has emerged in management debates as promising innovation inspired by the way designers work. Despite the growing interest in DT, it is a difficult concept to study due to the lack of coherence between what DT ‘is' in academic and practical terms. While there are numerous normative and often process-focused depictions of DT, they seemlimited in their ability to account for what occurs in practice. Given the discussion of DT as a concept, and emerging discussion of its enactment, a framing is needed that acknowledges both aspects. This paper proposes a framing of DT that makes it researchable in both theory and practice, and discusses commonalities and discrepancies in how the concept is usually portrayed in the literature. The paper builds on an empirical interview study in six large organizations, which led to the development of a framework structure and the identification of five themes characterizing DT: User focus, Problem framing, Visualization, Experimentation and Diversity. Each theme is associated with specific principles/mindsets, practices and techniques. Themain contribution of this paper is to propose a framework that includesDT both as an idea and as the enactment of the idea, inspired by the works of Latour.},

abstract = {This book discusses how model-based approaches can improve the daily practice of software profes sionals. This is known as Model-Driven Software Engineering (MDSE) or, simply, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). MDSE practices have proved to increase efﬁciency and effectiveness in software development, as demonstrated by various quantitative and qualitative studies. MDSE adoption in the software industry is foreseen to grow exponentially in the near future, e.g., due to the convergence of software development and business analysis. The aim of this book is to provide you with an agile and ﬂexible tool to introduce you to the MDSE world, thus allowing you to quickly understand its basic principles and techniques and to choose the right set of MDSE instruments for your needs so that you can start to beneﬁt from MDSE right away. The book is organized into two main parts. • The ﬁrst part discusses the foundations of MDSE in terms of basic concepts (i.e., models and transformations), driving principles, application scenarios and current standards, like the well-known MDA initiative proposed by OMG (Object Management Group) as well as the practices on how to integrate MDSE in existing development processes. • The second part deals with the technical aspects of MDSE, spanning from the basics on when and how to build a domain-speciﬁc modeling language, to the description of Model-to-Text and Model-to-Model transformations, and the tools that support the management of MDSE projects. The book is targeted to a diverse set of readers, spanning: professionals, CTOs, CIOs, and team managers that need to have a bird's eye vision on the matter, so as to take the appropriate decisions when it comes to choosing the best development techniques for their company or team; software analysts, developers, or designers that expect to use MDSE for improving everyday work productivity, either by applying the basic modeling techniques and notations or by deﬁning new domain-speciﬁc modeling languages and applying end-to-end MDSE practices in the software factory; and academic teachers and students to address undergrad and postgrad courses on MDSE.},

abstract = {In this paper, we attempt to address the relative absence of empirical studies of model driven engineering through describing the practices of three commercial organizations as they adopted a model driven engineering approach to their software development. Using in-depth semi-structured interviewing we invited practitioners to reflect on their experiences and selected three to use as exemplars or case studies. In documenting some details of attempts to deploy model driven practices, we identify some 'lessons learned', in particular the importance of complex organizational, managerial and social factors - as opposed to simple technical factors - in the relative success, or failure, of the endeavour. As an example of organizational change management the successful deployment of model driven engineering appears to require: a progressive and iterative approach; transparent organizational commitment and motivation; integration with existing organizational processes and a clear business focus.},

abstract = {Planning optimal paths for large numbers of robots is computationally expensive. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for multirobot path planning called subdimensional expansion, which initially plans for each robot individually, and then coordinates motion among the robots as needed. More specifically, subdimensional expansion initially creates a one-dimensional search space embedded in the joint configuration space of the multirobot system. When the search space is found to be blocked during planning by a robot-robot collision, the dimensionality of the search space is locally increased to ensure that an alternative path can be found. As a result, robots are only coordinated when necessary, which reduces the computational cost of finding a path. We present the M∗ algorithm, an implementation of subdimensional expansion that adapts the A∗ planner to perform efficient multirobot planning. M∗ is proven to be complete and to find minimal cost paths. Simulation results are presented that show that M∗ outperforms existing optimal multirobot path planning algorithms.},

abstract = {In the near future mobile robots, such as personal robots or mobile manipulators, will share the workspace with other robots and humans. We present a method for mission and motion planning that applies to small teams of robots performing a task in an environment with mov-ing obstacles, such as humans. Given a mission specification written in linear temporal logic, such as patrolling a set of Javier Alonso-Mora and Jonathan A. DeCastro have contributed equally to this work. This is one of several papers published in Autonomous Robots com-prising the Special Issue on Online Decision Making in Multi-Robot Coordination. rooms, we synthesize an automaton from which the robots can extract valid strategies. This centralized automaton is executed by the robots in the team at runtime, and in con-junction with a distributed motion planner that guarantees avoidance of moving obstacles. Our contribution is a correct-by-construction synthesis approach to multi-robot mission planning that guarantees collision avoidance with respect to moving obstacles, guarantees satisfaction of the mission specification and resolves encountered deadlocks, where a moving obstacle blocks the robot temporally. Our method provides conditions under which deadlock will be avoided by identifying environment behaviors that, when encountered at runtime, may prevent the robot team from achieving its goals. In particular, (1) it identifies deadlock conditions; (2) it is able to check whether they can be resolved; and (3) the robots implement the deadlock resolution policy locally in a distributed manner. The approach is capable of synthesiz-ing and executing plans even with a high density of dynamic obstacles. In contrast to many existing approaches to mis-sion and motion planning, it is scalable with the number of moving obstacles. We demonstrate the approach in physical experiments with walking humanoids moving in 2D envi-ronments and in simulation with aerial vehicles (quadrotors) navigating in 2D and 3D environments.},

The solution determines robotic trajectories and updates them whenever necessary, such that the task is most likely to be satisfied with respect to probabilistic information on regions. The robots' movement capabilities are abstracted to finite state descriptions, and operations as product automata and graph searches are used in the provided solution. The approach builds up on temporal logic control strategies for static environments by incorporating probabilistic information and by designing an execution monitoring strategy that reacts to actual region observations yielded by robots. Several simulations are included, and a software implementation of the solution is available. The computational complexity of our approach increases exponentially when more robots are considered, and we mention a possible solution to reduce the computational complexity by fusing regions with identical observations.},

Under the assumption that time-varying rewards are associated with states of the system and these rewards can be observed in real-time, the control objective is to maximize the collected reward while satisfying the high level task specification. In order to properly react to the changing rewards, a controller synthesis framework inspired by model predictive control is proposed, where the rewards are locally optimized at each time-step over a finite horizon, and the optimal control computed for the current time-step is applied. By enforcing appropriate constraints, the infinite trajectory produced by the controller is guaranteed to satisfy the desired temporal logic formula.

We formulate two synthesis problems where the desired STL specification is enforced by maximizing the probability of satisfaction, and the expected robustness degree, that is, a measure quantifying the quality of satisfaction. We discuss that Q-learning is not directly applicable to these problems because, based on the quantitative semantics of STL, the probability of satisfaction and expected robustness degree are not in the standard objective form of Q-learning. To resolve this issue, we propose an approximation of STL synthesis problems that can be solved via Q-learning, and we derive some performance bounds for the policies obtained by the approximate approach.

A traditional automata-based approach to multi-agent strategy synthesis from such specifications builds on centralized planning for the whole team and thus suffers from extreme computational demands.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer International Publishing AG. The use of robots is gaining considerable traction in several domains, since they are capable of assisting and replacing humans for everyday tasks. To harvest the full potential of robots, it must be possible to define missions for robots that are domain-specific, resilient, and collaborative. Currently, robot vendors provide low-level APIs to program such missions, making mission definition a task-specific and error-prone activity. There is a need for quick definition of new missions, by users that lack programming expertise, such as farmers and emergency workers. In this paper, we extend the existing FLYAQ platform to support the high-level specification of adaptive and highly-resilient missions. We present an extensible specification language that allows users to declaratively specify domain-specific constraints as properties of missions, thus complementing the existing FLYAQ mission language. This permits to move at runtime, the actual generation of low-level operations to satisfy the declaratively specified mission. We show how this specification language can be automatically generated from a domain-specific FLYAQ mission language by using the generative ProMoBox approach. Next, we show how mission goals are achieved taking mission properties into account, and how missions may change due to unexpected circumstances.},

abstract = {Given the availability of large source-code repositories, there has been a large number of applications for large-scale clone detection. Unfortunately, despite a decade of active re-search, there is a marked lack in clone detectors that scale to big software systems or large repositories, specifically for detecting near-miss (Type 3) clones where significant editing activities may take place in the cloned code. This paper demonstrates: (i) SourcererCC, a token-based clone detector that targets the first three clone types, and exploits an index to achieve scalability to large inter-project repositories using a standard workstation. It uses an opti-mized inverted-index to quickly query the potential clones of a given code block. Filtering heuristics based on token or-dering are used to significantly reduce the size of the index, the number of code-block comparisons needed to detect the clones, as well as the number of required token-comparisons needed to judge a potential clone; and (ii) SourcererCC-I, an Eclipse plug-in, that uses SourcererCC's core engine to identify and navigate clones (both inter and intra project) in real-time during software development. In our experiments, comparing SourcererCC with the state-of-the-art tools 1 , we found that it is the only clone detection tool to successfully scale to 250 MLOC on a standard work-station with 12 GB RAM and efficiently detect the first three types of clones (precision 86{\%} and recall 86-100{\%}).

abstract = {Specifying a reactive behavioral configuration for use by a multiagent team requires both a careful choice of the behavior set and the creation of a temporal chain of behaviors which executes the mission. This difficult task is simplified by applying an object-oriented approach to the design of the mission using a construction called an assemblage and a methodology called temporal sequencing. The assemblage construct allows building high level primitives which provide abstractions for the designer. Assemblages consist of groups of basic behaviors and coordination mechanisms that allow the group to be treated as a new coherent behavior. Upon instantiation, the assemblage is parameterized based on the specific mission requirements. Assemblages can be re-parameterized and used in other states within a mission or archived as high level primitives for use in subsequent projects. Temporal sequencing partitions the mission into discrete operating states with perceptual triggers causing transitions between those states. Several smaller independent configurations (assemblages) can then be created which each implement one state. The Societal Agent theory is presented as a basis for constructions of this form. The Configuration Description Language ({\{}CDL){\}} is developed to capture the recursive composition of configurations in an architecture- and robot-independent fashion. The {\{}MissionLab{\}} system, an implementation based on {\{}CDL{\}}, supports the graphical construction of configurations using a visual editor. Various multiagent missions are demonstrated in simulation and on our Denning robots using these tools.},

@article{Park2016,
abstract = {This paper is focused on the development and analysis of suboptimal decision algorithms for a collection of robots that assist a remotely located operator in perimeter surveillance. The operator is tasked with the classification of incursions across the perimeter. whenever there is an incursion into the perimeter, an unattended ground sensor (UGS) in the vicinity, signals an alert. A robot services the alert by visiting the alert location, collecting information, e.g., photo and video imagery, and transmitting it to the operator. The accuracy of operator's classification depends on the volume and freshness of information gathered and provided by the robots at locations where incursions occur. There are two competing objectives for a robot: it needs to spend adequate time at an alert location to collect evidence for aiding the operator in accurate classification but it also needs to service other alerts as soon as possible, so that the evidence collected is relevant. The decision problem is to determine the optimal amount of time a robot must spend servicing an alert. The incursions are stochastic and their statistics are assumed to be known. This problem can be posed as a Markov Decision Problem. However, even for two robots and five UGS locations, the number of states is of the order of billions rendering exact dynamic programming methods intractable. Approximate dynamic programming (ADP) via linear programming (LP) provides a way to approximate the value function and derive suboptimal strategies. The novel feature of this paper is the derivation of a tractable lower bound via LP and the construction of a suboptimal policy whose performance improves upon the lower bound. An illustrative perimeter surveillance example corroborates the results derived in this paper. Note to Practitioners-In practice, one often encounters the curse of dimensionality in the application of dynamic programming to determine optimal policies for controlled Markov chains. This is true, in particular, for dynamic scheduling problems involving multiple robots/servers and queues of tasks that arrive in a stochastic fashion. The computation of value function, critical to the determination of optimal policies, is nearly impractical. Hence, one must settle for suboptimal policies. Two natural questions arise: (1) How does one construct a suboptimal policy? (2) How “good” is the constructed suboptimal policy? A common strategy to tackle the first problem is to approximate the value function and construct a suboptimal policy that is greedy with respect to the approximate value function. Typically, an approximate value function is constructed via a choice of basis functions. The question of how to choose the basis functions systematically for any problem is a difficult one; usually, the structure of the problem at hand is exploited in the construction of basis functions. The same approach is taken here and the state space is partitioned based on the reward structure and the optimal cost-to-go or value function is approximated by a constant over each partition. The second question is related to the first question in the sense that one needs to construct bounds for the performance of a suboptimal policy. In this paper, we construct upper and lower bounds for the value function (optimal performance) and use the lower bound as an approximate value function. Furthermore, we also show that the resulting suboptimal policy comes with a performance guarantee, in that it improves on the lower bound, it was derived from. Literature is replete with techniques for computing upper bounds; however, there is little work on lower bounds, which are also required for bounding the suboptimality of the policy. One encounters prohibitively large number of constraints in the case of computing an upper bound and has to deal with disjunctive linear inequalities in the case of a lower bound. The problem structure is exploited here to circumvent these difficulties. The upper and lower bounds to the value function developed in this paper could also be used to refine the partitions by identifying the partition with the largest difference between the upper and lower bounds; such a partition could be refined further using the structure of the problem. For practitioners, this could be a useful set of tools for generating suboptimal policies for any controlled Markov chain with a reward function that is amenable to state aggregation.},

abstract = {Reliability has become an integral component of the design intent of embedded cyber-physical systems. Safety-critical embedded systems are designed with specific reliability targets, and design practices include the appropriate allocation of both spatial and temporal redundancies in the implementation to meet such requirements. With increasing complexity of such systems and considering the large number of components in such systems, redundancy allocation requires a formal scientific basis. In this work, we profess the analysis of the redundancy requirement upfront with the objective of making it an integral part of the specification. The underlying problem is one of synthesizing a formal specification with built-in redundancy artifacts, from the formal properties of the error-free system, the error probabilities of the control components, and the reliability target. We believe that upfront formal analysis of redundancy requirements is important in budgeting the resource requirements from a cost versus reliability perspective. Several case-studies from the automotive domain highlight the efficacy of our proposal.},

As the agents might not be capable of satisfying their respective goals by themselves, requests for other agents' collaborations are a part of the task descriptions. We consider that each agent is modeled as a discrete state-transition system and its task specification takes a form of a linear temporal logic formula. A traditional automata-based approach to multi-agent plan synthesis from such specifications builds on centralized team planning and full team synchronization after each agents' discrete step, and thus suffers from extreme computational demands. We aim at reducing the computational complexity by decomposing the plan synthesis problem into finite horizon planning problems that are solved iteratively, upon the run of the agents. We introduce an event-based synchronization that allows our approach to efficiently adapt to different time durations of different agents' discrete steps. We discuss the correctness of the solution and find assumptions, under which the proposed iterative algorithm leads to provable eventual satisfaction of the desired specifications.},

abstract = {Traditional formal methods are based on a Boolean satisfaction notion: a reactive system satisfies, or not, a given specification. We generalize formal methods to also address the quality of systems. As an adequate specification formalism we introduce the linear temporal logic LTL[F]. The satisfaction value of an LTL[F] formula is a number between 0 and 1, describing the quality of the satisfaction. The logic generalizes traditional LTL by augmenting it with a (parameterized) set F of arbitrary functions over the interval [0,1]. For example, F may contain the maximum or minimum between the satisfaction values of subformulas, their product, and their average. The classical decision problems in formal methods, such as satisfiability, model checking, and synthesis, are generalized to search and optimization problems in the quantitative setting. For example, model checking asks for the quality in which a specification is satisfied, and synthesis returns a system satisfying the specification with the highest quality. Reasoning about quality gives rise to other natural questions, like the distance between specifications. We formalize these basic questions and study them for LTL[F]. By extending the automata-theoretic approach for LTL to a setting that takes quality into an account, we are able to solve the above problems and show that reasoning about LTL[F] has roughly the same complexity as reasoning about traditional LTL. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

Although claimed to be beneficial, the software development community as a whole is still unfamiliar with the role of the requirements engineering practices in agile methods. The term "agile requirements engineering" is used to define the "agile way" of planning, executing and reasoning about requirements engineering activities. Moreover, not much is known about the challenges posed by collaboration-oriented agile way of dealing with requirements engineering activities. Our goal is to map the evidence available about requirements engineering practices adopted and challenges faced by agile teams in order to understand how traditional requirements engineering issues are resolved using agile requirements engineering. We conducted a systematic review of literature published between 2002 and June 2013 and identified 21 papers, that discuss agile requirements engineering. We formulated and applied specific inclusion and exclusion criteria in two distinct rounds to determine the most relevant studies for our research goal. The review identified 17 practices of agile requirements engineering, five challenges traceable to traditional requirements engineering that were overcome by agile requirements engineering, and eight challenges posed by the practice of agile requirements engineering. However, our findings suggest that agile requirements engineering as a research context needs additional attention and more empirical results are required to better understand the impact of agile requirements engineering practices e.g. dealing with non-functional requirements and self-organising teams.},

Nevertheless, the transition of this technology from research to practice has been slow. While there are a number of potential causes for reluctance to adopt such formal methods, we believe that a primary cause is that practitioners are unfamiliar with specification processes, notations, and strategies. In a recent paper, we proposed a pattern-based approach to the presentation, codification and reuse of property specifications for finite-state verification. Since then, we have carried out a survey of available specifications, collecting over 500 examples of property specifications. We found that most are instances of our proposed patterns. Furthermore, we have updated our pattern system to accommodate new patterns and variations of existing patterns encountered in this survey. This paper reports the results of the survey and the current status of our pattern system.},

abstract = {We propose a cooperative motion and task planning scheme for multi-agent systems where the agents have independently assigned local tasks, specified as linear temporal logic formulas. These tasks contain hard and soft sub-specifications. A least-violating initial plan is synthesized first for the potentially infeasible task and the partially-known workspace. This discrete plan is then implemented by the potential-field-based navigation controllers. While the system runs, each agent updates its knowledge about the workspace via its sensing capability and shares this knowledge with its neighbouring agents. Based on the knowledge update, each agent verifies and revises its motion plan in real time. It is ensured that the hard specification is always fulfilled for safety and the satisfaction for the soft specification is improved gradually. The design is distributed as only local interactions are assumed. The overall framework is demonstrated by a case study and an experiment.},

An additional objective of RoCKIn is to increase public awareness of the current state-of-the-art in robotics and the innovation potential of robotics applications. From these objectives several requirements for the work performed in RoCKIn can be derived: • The RoCKIn competitions must start from convincing, easy-to-communicate user stories, that catch the attention of relevant stakeholders, the media, and the crowd. The user stories play the role of a mid-to long-term vision for a competition. Prefer-ably, the user stories address economic, societal, or environmental problems. • The RoCKIn competitions must pose open scientific challenges of interest to suffi-ciently many researchers to attract existing and new teams of robotics researchers for participation in the competition. The competitions need to promise some suit-able reward, such as recognition in the scientific community, publicity for a team's work, awards, or prize money, to justify the effort a team puts into the development of a competition entry. The competitions should be designed in such a way that they reward general, scientifically sound solutions to the challenge problems; such general solutions should score better than approaches that work only in narrowly defined contexts and are considred over-engineered.},

abstract = {The standardization of planning problems by their descriptions in the PDDL has resulted in clear benchmarking of planners, and thus, in significant advances in reliable and efficient planning packages. The output of these classical planners is a plan as sequence of actions for the controllable robots in the environment. We show here that, provided that the adversaries follow a deterministic behavior, PDDLplanners can also be used in dynamic environments where uncontrollable adversaries may obstruct paths at some time in the future. Therefore, these environments can be used by mobile robots without the need to use more sophisticated planners where environments are modeled by Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We created a planning API for integrating any PDDLsolver and use it to elaborate platform independent planning behavior. We also have the ability of switching between PDDLsolvers or to change the integration cycle of the planner. We show that these two features are essential for the dynamic environments considered here},

@article{Guo2017,
abstract = {— We consider a multiagent system that consists of heterogeneous groups of homogeneous agents. Instead of defining a global task for the whole team, each agent is assigned a local task as syntactically cosafe linear temporal logic formulas that specify both motion and action requirements. Interagent dependence is introduced by collaborative actions, of which the execution requires multiple agents' collaboration. To ensure the satisfaction of all local tasks without central coordination, we propose a bottom–up motion and task coordination strategy that contains an off-line initial plan synthesis and an online coordination scheme based on real-time exchange of request and reply messages. It facilitates not only the collaboration among heterogeneous agents but also the task swapping between homogeneous agents to reduce the total execution cost. It is distributed as any decision is made locally by each agent based on local computation and communication within neighboring agents. It is scalable and resilient to agent failures as the dependence is formed and removed dynamically based on agent capabilities and their plan execution status, instead of preassigned agent identities. The overall scheme is demonstrated by a simulated scenario of 20 agents with loosely coupled local tasks. Note to Practitioners—This paper was motivated by the prob-lem of coordinating a large number of autonomous robots in collaborative manufacturing and delivery processes, where each robot has an individual task but collaborations among the robots are essential for the accomplishment of all tasks. Existing approaches to address such problems rely on the direct composition of all robots' models and tasks, yielding a high complexity of computation and difficulty of coordination, where all robot behaviors are synchronized at all time and coordinated centrally. In this paper, through a local request and reply commu-nication protocol, we remove these constraints and impose only local coordination rules among the robots. Moreover, compared with the common solutions, where interrobot collaborations are bound to preassigned robot identities, we allow the robots to negotiate and choose their collaborators in a flexible way. It is guaranteed that the individual task of each robot is satisfied under the collaboration with other robots, but without the need of a central coordinator. We have shown that it is particularly useful for loosely coupled multirobot applications, where the interrobot collaborations are feasible and local. Simulation results suggest that this approach is applicable to large-scale multirobot systems and can be easily integrated with suitable low-level motion control strategies, but it has not yet been tested in experimental environments. In the future research, we will address more complex robot tasks and practical implementations.},

abstract = {Component-based programming frameworks for industrial control logic development promise to shorten development and modification times, and to reduce programming errors. To get these benefits, it is, however, important that the components are specified and verified to work properly. This work introduces Reusable Automation Components (RACs), which contain not only the implementation details but also a formal specification defining the correct use and behaviour of the component. This formal specification uses temporal logic to describe time-related properties and has a special structure developed to meet industrial control needs. The RAC can be formally verified, to determine whether the implementation fulfils the specification or not. A RAC prototype development tool has been developed to demonstrate this capability. The main difference between the RAC and other frameworks for formal verification of control logic is the specification modeling. In RAC, not only the implementation but also the specification is based on the structure and languages of conventional control logic, aiming at being easy to comprehend for control logic engineers. Several industrial examples are discussed in this paper, showing the benefits and potential of the framework.},

The objective is to optimize the system performance measured by the probability of satisfying a system specification in linear temporal logic, while ensuring a reasonable workload for the human operator. The synthesis method builds upon the construction of an abstract model for the given shared autonomy system from a set of components modeled by Markov decision processes, which are capable of capturing the uncertainty in the operator's performance and response to switching control signals under his different cognitive and physiological states. A cost function is then introduced to quantify the human operator's workload. In order to establish quantitative trade-offs between the operator's effort and the system performance, we propose a two-stage policy synthesis algorithm for generating Pareto-optimal switching control policies.},

Our previous research has studied the use of case-based reasoning (CBR) tools to assist a user in the generation of multi-robot missions. These tools, however, typically assume that the robots available for the mission are of the same type (i.e., homogeneous). We loosen this assumption through the integration of contract-net protocol (CNP) based task allocation coupled with a CBR-based mission specification wizard. Two alternative designs are explored for combining case-based mission specification and CNP-based team allocation as well as the tradeoffs that result from the selection of one of these approaches over the other.},

abstract = {—Recent advances in technology are delivering robots of reduced size and cost. A natural outgrowth of these advances are systems comprised of large numbers of robots that collaborate autonomously in diverse applications. Research on effective au-tonomous control of such systems, commonly called swarms, has increased dramatically in recent years and received attention from many domains, such as bioinspired robotics and control theory. These kinds of distributed systems present novel challenges for the effective integration of human supervisors, operators, and team-mates that are only beginning to be addressed. This paper is the first survey of human–swarm interaction (HSI) and identifies the core concepts needed to design a human–swarm system. We first present the basics of swarm robotics. Then, we introduce HSI from the perspective of a human operator by discussing the cognitive complexity of solving tasks with swarm systems. Next, we introduce the interface between swarm and operator and identify challenges and solutions relating to human–swarm communication, state es-timation and visualization, and human control of swarms. For the latter, we develop a taxonomy of control methods that enable op-erators to control swarms effectively. Finally, we synthesize the results to highlight remaining challenges, unanswered questions, and open problems for HSI, as well as how to address them in future works.

Nev-ertheless, the transition of this technology from research to practice has been slow. While there are a number of potential causes for reluctance in adopting such formal methods in practice, we believe that a primary cause rests with the fact that practitioners are unfamiliar with specifica-tion processes, notations, and strategies. Recent years have seen growing success in leveraging ex-perience with design and coding patterns. We propose a pattern-based approach to the presen-tation, codification and reuse of property speci-fications for finite-state verification.},

abstract = {Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) promotes the use of models to conduct all phases of software development in an automated way. Models are frequently defined using Domain- Specific Modelling Languages (DSMLs), which many times need to be developed for the domain at hand. However, while constructing DSMLs is a recurring activity in MDE, there is scarce support for gathering, reusing and enacting knowledge for their design and implementation. This forces the development of every new DSML to start from scratch. To alleviate this problem, we propose the construction of DSMLs and their modelling environments aided by patterns which gather knowledge of specific domains, design alternatives, concrete syntax, dynamic semantics and functionality for the modelling environment. They may have associated services, realized via components. Our approach is supported by a tool that enables the construction of DSMLs through the application of patterns, and synthesizes a graphical modelling environment according to them. {\&}copy; 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {Self-adaptive software is capable of evaluating and changing its own behavior, whenever the evaluation shows that the software is not accomplishing what it was intended to do, or when better functionality or performance may be possible. The topic of system adaptivity has been widely studied since the mid-60s and, over the past decade, several application areas and technologies relating to self-adaptivity have assumed greater importance. In all these initiatives, software has become the common element that introduces self-adaptability. Thus, the investigation of systematic software engineering approaches is necessary, in order to develop self-adaptive systems that may ideally be applied across multiple domains. The main goal of this study is to review recent progress on self-adaptivity from the standpoint of computer sciences and cybernetics, based on the analysis of state-of-the-art approaches reported in the literature. This review provides an over-arching, integrated view of computer science and software engineering foundations. Moreover, various methods and techniques currently applied in the design of self-adaptive systems are analyzed, as well as some European research initiatives and projects. Finally, the main bottlenecks for the effective application of self-adaptive technology, as well as a set of key research issues on this topic, are precisely identified, in order to overcome current constraints on the effective application of self-adaptivity in its emerging areas of application. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {UML class diagrams play a central role in modeling activities, and it is essential that class diagrams keep their high quality all along a product life cycle. Correctness problems in class diagrams are mainly caused by complex interactions among class-diagram constraints. Detection, identification, and repair of such problems require background training. In order to improve modelers' capabilities in these directions, we have constructed a catalog of anti-patterns of correctness and quality problems in class diagrams, where an anti-pattern analyzes a typical constraint interaction that causes a correctness or a quality problem and suggests possible repairs. This paper argues that exposure to correctness anti-patterns improves modeling capabilities. The paper introduces the catalog and its pattern language, and describes experiments that test the impact of awareness to modeling problems in class diagrams (via concrete examples and anti-patterns) on the analysis capabilities of modelers. The experiments show that increased awareness implies increased identification. The improvement is remarkably noticed when the awareness is stimulated by anti-patterns, rather than by concrete examples.},

abstract = {This paper provides a framework to automatically generate a hybrid controller that guarantees that the robot can achieve its task when a robot model, a class of admissible environ- ments, and a high-level task or behavior for the robot are provided. The desired task specifications, which are expressed in a fragment of linear temporal logic (LTL), can capture complex robot behav- iors such as search and rescue, coverage, and collision avoidance. In addition, our framework explicitly captures sensor specifications that depend on the environment with which the robot is interacting, which results in a novel paradigm for sensor-based temporal-logic- motion planning. As one robot is part of the environment of an- other robot, our sensor-based framework very naturally captures multirobot specifications in a decentralized manner. Our compu- tational approach is based on first creating discrete controllers satisfying specific LTL formulas. If feasible, the discrete controller is then used to guide the sensor-based composition of continuous controllers, which results in a hybrid controller satisfying the high- level specification but only if the environment is admissible.},

The natural language system uses domain-general components that can easily be adapted to cover the vocabulary of new applica-tions. Generation of a linear temporal logic specification from the user's natural language input uses a novel data structure that allows for subsequent mapping of logical propositions back to natural language, enabling natural language feedback about problems with the specification that are only identifi-able in the logical form. We demonstrate the robustness of the natural language understanding system through a user study where participants interacted with a simulated robot in a search and rescue scenario. Automated analysis and user feedback on unimplementable specifications is demonstrated using an example involving a robot assistant in a hospital.},

abstract = {Robots are increasingly used to perform a wide variety of tasks, especially those involving dangerous or inaccessible locations. As the complexity of such tasks grow, robots are being deployed in teams, with complex coordination schemes aimed at maximizing the chance of mission success. Such teams operate under inherently uncertain condi-tions – the robots themselves fail, and have to continuously adapt to changing environmental conditions. A key challenge facing robotic mis-sion designers is therefore to construct a mission – i.e., specify number and type of robots, number and size of teams, coordination and plan-ning mechanisms etc. – so as to maximize some overall utility, such as the probability of mission success. In this paper, we advocate, formal-ize, and empirically justify an approach to compute quantitative utility of robotic missions using probabilistic model checking. We show how to express a robotic demining mission as a restricted type of discrete time Markov chain (called $\alpha$PA), and its utility as either a linear temporal logic formula or a reward. We prove a set of compositionality theorems that enable us to compute the utility of a system composed of several $\alpha$PAs by combining the utilities of each $\alpha$PA in isolation. This ame-liorates the statespace explosion problem, even when the system being verified is composed of a large number of robots. We validate our ap-proach empirically, using the probabilistic model checker prism.},

abstract = {Temporal logics are commonly used for reasoning about concurrent systems. Model checkers and other finite-state verification techniques allow for automated checking of system model compliance to given temporal properties. These properties are typically specified as linear-time formulae in temporal logics. Unfortunately, the level of inherent sophistication required by these formalisms too often represents an impediment to move these techniques from “research theory” to “industry practice”. The objective of this work is to facilitate the nontrivial and error prone task of specifying, correctly and without expertise in temporal logic, temporal properties. In order to understand the basis of a simple but expressive formalism for specifying temporal properties we critically analyze commonly used in practice visual notations. Then we present a scenario-based visual language called Property Sequence Chart ({\{}{\{}{\}}PSC){\{}{\}}{\}} that, in our opinion, fixes the highlighted lacks of these notations by extending a subset of {\{}{\{}{\}}UML{\{}{\}}{\}} 2.0 Interaction Sequence Diagrams. We also provide {\{}{\{}{\}}PSC{\{}{\}}{\}} with both denotational and operational semantics. The operational semantics is obtained via translation into B{\{}{\"{u}}{\}}chi automata and the translation algorithm is implemented as a plugin of our Charmy tool. Expressiveness of {\{}{\{}{\}}PSC{\{}{\}}{\}} has been validated with respect to well known property specification patterns.},

abstract = {Linear Temporal Logic is gaining increasing popularity as a high level specification language for robot motion planning due to its expressive power and scalability of LTL control synthesis algorithms. This formalism, however, requires expert knowledge and makes it inaccessible to non-expert users. This thesis introduces a graphical specification environment to create high level motion plans to control robots in the field by converting a visual representation of the motion/task plan into a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) specification. The visual interface is built on the Android tablet platform and provides functionality to create task plans through a set of well defined gestures and on screen controls. It uses the notion of waypoints to quickly and efficiently describe the motion plan and enables a variety of complex Linear Temporal Logic specifications to be described succinctly and intuitively by the user without the need for the knowledge and understanding of LTL specification. Thus, it opens avenues for its use by personnel in military, warehouse management, and search and rescue missions. This thesis describes the construction of LTL for various scenarios used for robot navigation using the visual interface developed and leverages the use of existing LTL based motion planners to carry out the task plan by a robot.},

In order to increase the degree of autonomy in such systems so they can successfully participate in more complex mission scenarios such as those considered in emergency rescue that also include ongoing interactions with human operators, new architectural components and functionalities will be required to aid not only human operators in mission planning, but also the unmanned aircraft systems themselves in the automatic generation, execution and partial verification of mission plans to achieve mission goals.

abstract = {Multicopters are increasingly popular since they promise to simplify a myriad of everyday tasks. Currently, vendors provide low-level APIs and basic primitives to program multicopters, making mission development a task-specific and error-prone activity. As a consequence, current approaches are affordable only for users that have a strong technical expertise. Then, software engineering techniques are needed to support the definition, development, and realization of missions at the right level of abstraction and involving teams of autonomous multicopters that guarantee the safety today's users expect. In this paper we describe a tool that enables end-users with no technical expertise, e.g., firefighters and rescue workers, to specify missions for a team of multicopters. The detailed flight plan that each multicopter must perform to accomplish the specified mission is automatically generated by preventing collisions between multicopters and obstacles, and ensuring the preservation of no-fly zones.},

abstract = {Formal methods offer an effective means to assert the correctness of software systems through mathematical reasoning. However, the need to formulate system properties in a purely mathematical fashion can create pragmatic barriers to the application of these techniques. For this reason, Dwyer et al. invented property specification patterns which is a system of recurring solutions to deal with the temporal intricacies that would make the construction of reactive systems very hard otherwise. Today, property specification patterns provide general rules that help practitioners to qualify order and occurrence, to quantify time bounds, and to express probabilities of events. Nevertheless, a comprehensive framework combining qualitative, real-time, and probabilistic property specification patterns has remained elusive. The benefits of such a framework are twofold. First, it would remove the distinction between qualitative and quantitative aspects of events; and second, it would provide a structure to systematically discover new property specification patterns. In this paper, we report on such a framework and present a unified catalogue that combines all known plus 40 newly identified or extended patterns. We also offer a natural language front-end to map patterns to a temporal logic of choice. To demonstrate the virtue of this new framework, we applied it to a variety of industrial requirements, and use PSPWizard , a tool specifically developed to work with our unified pattern catalogue, to automatically render concrete instances of property specification patterns to formulae of an underlying temporal logic of choice. {\textcopyright} 1976-2012 IEEE.},

GMoDS is used to capture system-level goals that drive the system. OMACS is an abstract model used to capture the system configuration and allows the team to organize and reorganize without the need for explicit runtime reorganization rules. While OMACS provides an implicit reorganization capability, it also supports policies that can either guide or restrict the resulting organizations thus limiting unexpected or harmful adaptation. We demonstrate our framework by presenting the design and implementation of a multi-robot system for detecting improvised explosive devices. We then highlight the adaptability of the resulting system.},

abstract = {Current state-of-the-art robot program development needs expert programmers. Moreover, most robot programs developed today are robot hardware and software specific, and therefore little reusable without modifications. This paper realizes easier robot (re-)programming, by software framework independent models that can be executed using different hard- and software platforms. First, the paper focuses on the formalization of the tasks to be fulfilled by a robot, more specifically constraint-based programming tasks using a Domain Specific Language (DSL). Second, it gives a reference implementation in Lua [1]. The presented DSL makes it easy to develop applications, yet is powerful to execute. It enables automatic model verification and code generation for different hard- and software platforms, diminishing code debugging efforts. Experimental validation shows the ease of creating an application and adapting it, the reduction of the amount of hand-written code, and the debugging aid offered through meaningful errors returned by model verification.},

The language offers three different level of abstraction for robot programming. On lowest level skills are coded by domain experts. On a more abstract level these skills are supposed to be combined by shop floor workers or technicians to define tasks. The language is designed to allow as much flexibility as necessary on the lowest level of abstraction and is kept as simple as possible with the more abstract layers. A Statechart like model is used to describe the different levels of detail. For this we apply the UML/P and the language workbench MontiCore. To this end we are able to generate code while hiding controller specific implementation details. In addition the development in LightRocks is supported by a generic graphical editor implemented as an Eclipse plugin.},

The study presents an original longitudinal study of project member experiences. In this paper, we have described and analysed one core category, project power, which was derived from a grounded theory (GT) study. This study extends existing theories about power in organisational contexts, in particular the everyday use of power in projects. The paper shows how GT can be used to gain significant insights into a case study, and also generate new concepts. This paper gives detailed insights into the power issues as they played out in a complex IOIS project. This IOIS project spanned four user organisations, two suppliers, one national organisation, a research organisation and a government Ministry. One key finding is that, given the complexity of the project management structures in an IOIS project such as this, project members often resorted to formal authority as a means of getting things done, in the absence of informal links between organisations. The project history also had major ramifications on the use of power in this project.

abstract = {Guidelines for determining nonprobabilistic sample sizes are virtually nonexistent. Purposive samples are the most commonly used form of nonprobabilistic sampling, and their size typically relies on the concept of “saturation,” or the point at which no new information or themes are observed in the data. Although the idea of saturation is helpful at the conceptual level, it provides little practical guidance for estimating sample sizes, prior to data collection, necessary for conducting quality research. Using data from a study involving sixty in-depth interviews with women in two West African countries, the authors systematically document the degree of data saturation and variability over the course of thematic analysis. They operationalize saturation and make evidence-based recommendations regarding nonprobabilistic sample sizes for interviews. Based on the data set, they found that saturation occurred within the first twelve interviews, although basic elements for metathemes were present as early as six interviews. Variability within the data followed similar patterns.},

We focus on the liminal periods experienced by institutional entrepreneurs when they, unlike the rest of the organization, recognize limits in the present and seek to shift a familiar past into an unfamiliar and uncertain future. Such periods involve a situation where the new possible future, not yet fully formed, exists side-by-side with established innovation trajectories. Trajectory shifts are moments of truth for institutional entrepreneurs, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms of how entrepreneurs reflectively deal with liminality to conceive and bring forth new innovation trajectories. Our in-depth case study research at CarCorp traces three such mechanisms (reflective dissension, imaginative projection, and eliminatory exploration) and builds the basis for understanding the liminality of trajectory shifts. The paper offers theoretical implications for the institutional entrepreneurship l...},

abstract = {The development of advanced robotic systems is challenging as expertise from multiple domains needs to be integrated conceptually and technically. Model-driven engineering promises an efficient and flexible approach for developing robotics applications that copes with this challenge. Domain-specific modeling allows to describe robotics concerns with concepts and notations closer to the respective problem domain. This raises the level of abstraction and results in models that are easier to understand and validate. Furthermore, model-driven engineering allows to increase the level of automation, e.g. through code generation, and to bridge the gap between modeling and implementation. The anticipated results are improved efficiency and quality of the robotics systems engineering process. Within this contribution, we survey the available literature on domain-specific modeling and languages that target core robotics concerns. In total 137 publications were identified that comply with a set of defined criteria, which we consider essential for contributions in this field. With the presented survey, we provide an overview on the state-of-the-art of domain-specific modeling approaches in robotics. The surveyed publications are investigated from the perspective of users and developers of model-based approaches in robotics along a set of quantitative and qualitative research questions. The presented quantitative analysis clearly indicates the rising popularity of applying domain-specific modeling approaches to robotics in the academic community. Beyond this statistical analysis, we map the selected publications to a defined set of robotics subdomains and typical development phases in robotic systems engineering as reference for potential users. Furthermore, we analyze these contributions from a language engineering viewpoint and discuss aspects such as the methods and tools used for their implementation as well as their documentation status, platform integration, typical use cases and the evaluation strategies used for validation of the proposed approaches. Finally, we conclude with recommendations for discussion in the model-driven engineering and robotics community based on the insights gained in this survey.},

abstract = {Mobile robots range from the teleoperated Sojourner on the Mars Pathfinder mission to cleaning robots in the Paris Metro. Introduction to Autonomous Mobile Robots offers students and other interested readers an overview of the technology of mobilitythe mechanisms that allow a mobile robot to move through a real world environment to perform its tasksincluding locomotion, sensing, localization, and motion planning. It discusses all facets of mobile robotics, including hardware design, wheel design, kinematics analysis, sensors and perception, localization, mapping, and robot control architectures.The design of any successful robot involves the integration of many different disciplines, among them kinematics, signal analysis, information theory, artificial intelligence, and probability theory. Reflecting this, the book presents the techniques and technology that enable mobility in a series of interacting modules. Each chapter covers a different aspect of mobility, as the book moves from low-level to high-level details. The first two chapters explore low-level locomotory ability, examining robots' wheels and legs and the principles of kinematics. This is followed by an in-depth view of perception, including descriptions of many "off-the-shelf" sensors and an analysis of the interpretation of sensed data. The final two chapters consider the higher-level challenges of localization and cognition, discussing successful localization strategies, autonomous mapping, and navigation competence. Bringing together all aspects of mobile robotics into one volume, Introduction to Autonomous Mobile Robots can serve as a textbook for coursework or a working tool for beginners in the field.},

abstract = {Empirically based theories are generally perceived as foundational to science. However, in many disciplines, the nature, role and even the necessity of theories remain matters for debate, particularly in young or practical disciplines such as software engineering. This article reports a systematic review of the explicit use of theory in a comprehensive set of 103 articles reporting experiments, from of a total of 5,453 articles published in major software engineering journals and conferences in the decade 1993-2002. Of the 103 articles, 24 use a total of 40 theories in various ways to explain the cause-effect relationship(s) under investigation. The majority of these use theory in the experimental design to justify research questions and hypotheses, some use theory to provide post hoc explanations of their results, and a few test or modify theory. A third of the theories are proposed by authors of the reviewed articles. The interdisciplinary nature of the theories used is greater than that of research in software engineering in general. We found that theory use and awareness of theoretical issues are present, but that theory-driven research is, as yet, not a major issue in empirical software engineering. Several articles comment explicitly on the lack of relevant theory. We call for an increased awareness of the potential benefits of involving theory, when feasible. To support software engineering researchers who wish to use theory, we show which of the reviewed articles on which topics use which theories for what purposes, as well as details of the theories' characteristics},

Design science research is yet another "lens" or set of synthetic and analytical techniques and perspectives (complementing the Positivist and Interpretive perspectives) for performing research in IS. Design science research involves the creation of new knowledge through design of novel or innovative artifacts (things or processes that have or can have material existence) and analysis of the use and/or performance of such artifacts along with reflection and abstraction—to improve and understand the behavior of aspects of Information Systems. Such artifacts include—but certainly are not limited to—algorithms (e.g. for information retrieval), human/computer interfaces, and system design methodologies or languages. Design science researchers can be found in many disciplines and fields, notably Engineering and Computer Science; they use a variety of approaches, methods and techniques. In Information Systems, following a number of years of a general shift in IS research away from technological to managerial and organizational issues, an increasing number of observers are calling for a return to an exploration of the "IT" that underlies all IS research (Orlikowski and Iacono, 2001) thus underlining the need for IS design science research.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that, in order to maintain its relevance, critical research must develop a strong emphasis on empirical work rather than the conceptual emphasis that has typically characterized critical scholarship in management. A critical project of this nature is applicable in the information systems (IS) arena, which has a growing tradition of qualitative inquiry. Despite its relativist ontology, actor–network theory places a strong emphasis on empirical inquiry and this paper argues that actor–network theory, with its careful tracing and recording of heterogeneous networks, is well suited to the generation of detailed and contextual empirical knowledge about IS. The intention in this paper is to explore the relevance of IS research informed by actor–network theory in the pursuit of a broader critical research project as de ned in earlier work.},

abstract = {A number of models have been offered to help explain the trajectories of e-Government projects: their frequent failures and their rarer successes. Most, though, lack a sense of the political interaction of stakeholders that is fundamental to understanding the public sector. This paper draws on actor- network theory to provide a perspective that is used to explain the trajectory of an e-Government case study. This perspective is found to provide a valuable insight into the local and global actor-networks that surround e-Government projects. The mobilisation, interaction and disintegration of these networks underpins the course of such projects, and can itself be understood in relation to network actor power: not through a static conception of power over others but through the dynamic-enacted concept of power to. As well as providing a research tool for analysis of e-Government project trajectories, the local/global networks approach also offers insights into e-Government leadership as a process of network formation and maintenance; and into the tensions between network stabilisation and design stabilisation.},

@article{Ranerup2007,
abstract = {It is argued here that Electronic Government (E-Gov) research to date has misconceived humans and technology, tending to give primacy to one or the other, but failing to grapple with their interaction. The present paper tries to remedy this by introducing an Actor-Network Theory (ANT) inspired approach in which the principle of symmetry is applied to an empirical case. This perspective emphasizes agency as a combination of actions of humans and technology, both separately and in conjunction (a "hybrid"). The research context is a computerized decision support (DSS) for portfolio management in the premium pension system in Sweden. The study shows that a system incorporating humans in conjunction with the DSS (a "hybrid") is able to make advanced economic decisions in line with pension policy by incorporating the preferences and characteristics of humans as well as the capabilities of technology. From a more general perspective, E-Gov is discussed today as a way of extending the hybridization of society, which is becoming an increasingly important component of the state's relationship with its citizens. The paper also discusses methodological implications, most importantly how to represent technology in a symmetrical analysis and how to avoid excessive detail in reporting.},

Library Trends, 55(1), 171–189. doi:10.1353/lib.2006.0045 (Baker, 2006) Observation as a research method has been called the “bedrock source of human knowledge” by Adler and Adler (1994). Cited as being used by ancient researchers including Aristotle and Auguste Comte, observation has been used for as long as human history has been recorded in an attempt to understand the world. In modern times, observation as a research method has become nebulous in definition. A variety of labels referring to observation as a research method seem to be used interchangeably by researchers including observation, participant observation, and ethnography. Within these broad terms for observation there are several roles a researcher may take depending on the study ranging from nonparticipation to complete membership in the group being studied. Nonparticipation is at one end of the continuum of roles a researcher may play in observation as a research method. In this role, the researcher has no involvement with the participants of the research. The researcher may analyze data about people or watch groups and individuals via camera. The individuals being observed may or may not be aware of the researcher. Slightly more involved with the participants than the non-participatory researcher is the complete observer. In this role, the researcher is present with the individuals being studied, but takes special care to detach from the group. This role is limited in value due to lack of access to ‘insider' information. It is, however, a good starting point to collect baseline data on a group. An observer as participant is still primarily a researcher and so maintains a certain detachment from the group, but interacts with participants through interviews and conversations. In this role, the participants are aware of the researcher's presence in the group. More popular with qualitative researchers is the role of moderate or peripheral membership. This role involves a balance between insider and outsider. The researcher limits their involvement so as not to influence the specific activities being studied. In some cases, it is advantageous for the researcher to gain active membership in the group. In this role, the researcher participates in the activities of the group and even develops relationships with group members. This can be necessary when the researcher needs to understand intimate information or intricate details of an activity. Finally, complete participation is at the complete opposite end of the continuum from nonparticipation. In this role, the researcher acts as a member and not primarily as a researcher. This role gives the researcher a thorough and intimate understanding of the group, but can become too involved to remain objective. Adler, P. A., {\&} Adler, P. (1994). Observational techniques.

In this traditional model of ethnography, one of the most important data-gathering techniques is participant observation. The ethnographer observes and participates but does not actively seek to change the situation. In recent years, however, a new type of ethnographic research has emerged – one that can be called design ethnography. Design ethnography is where the researcher goes beyond observation and actively engages with people in the field. Our view is that design ethnography has much potential for research in information systems. It is a new form of engaged scholarship that bridges the gap between ethnographic research and design science research.},

In my own areas of research -- human-computer interaction and computer- supported co-operative work, it has transformed thinking about the role of users in the software development process. However, participatory design refers to a high-level feature of design methods that can be implemented in myriad ways. It is not a single and integral design method. In this paper, I discuss several dimensions of possible implementations of participatory design: domains of human activity — roles of stakeholders in a design, types of shared design representations, the scope and duration of participatory interactions, and the relationship of users to design activity with respect to changes in their knowledge and skill. I believe these dimensions},

abstract = {Due to a general shift in manufacturing paradigm from mass production towards mass customization, reconfigurable automation technologies, such as robots, are required. However, current industrial robot solutions are notoriously difficult to program, leading to high changeover times when new products are introduced by manufacturers. In order to compete on global markets, the factories of tomorrow need complete production lines, including automation technologies that can effortlessly be reconfigured or repurposed, when the need arises. In this paper we present the concept of general, self-asserting robot skills for manufacturing. We show how a relatively small set of skills are derived from current factory worker instructions, and how these can be transferred to industrial mobile manipulators. General robot skills can not only be implemented on these robots, but also be intuitively concatenated to program the robots to perform a variety of tasks, through the use of simple task-level programming methods. We demonstrate various approaches to this, extensively tested with several people inexperienced in robotics. We validate our findings through several deployments of the complete robot system in running production facilities at an industrial partner. It follows from these experiments that the use of robot skills, and associated task-level programming framework, is a viable solution to introducing robots that can intuitively and on the fly be programmed to perform new tasks by factory workers.},

abstract = {Robotics applications involve robots that perform tasks by interacting with specific worlds. Most applications are intertwined with and tied to fixed robots and worlds. Changes and evolution of a robot or world have an invasive and often unpredictable impact on the application software. We propose making the models of robots and worlds explicit in robotics applications and separate these by introducing application-specific and platform-independent interfaces. This separation allows modular model-driven development of robotics applications and enables the reuse and adaptation of models and applications without need for invasive modifications. We present a framework with a family of modeling languages for conceptual, platform-independent applications, tasks, robots, and worlds. The model-driven RoboTask framework integrates these languages with a runtime architecture to execute robotics tasks using a planner and mappings from conceptual models to actual platforms. This enables a separation of domain concerns from software development concerns and modification of applications without invasive impacts on their separated constituents. We believe that the enabled reuse and adaptation lead to more efficient development and higher quality software for robotics applications.},

abstract = {Although different approaches to decision-making in self-adaptive systems have shown their effectiveness in the past by factoring in predictions about the system and its environ-ment (e.g., resource availability), no proposal considers the latency associated with the execution of tactics upon the tar-get system. However, different adaptation tactics can take different amounts of time until their effects can be observed. In reactive adaptation, ignoring adaptation tactic latency can lead to suboptimal adaptation decisions (e.g., activat-ing a server that takes more time to boot than the transient spike in traffic that triggered its activation). In proactive adaptation, taking adaptation latency into account is nec-essary to get the system into the desired state to deal with an upcoming situation. In this paper, we introduce a for-mal analysis technique based on model checking of stochas-tic multiplayer games (SMGs) that enables us to quantify the potential benefits of employing different types of algo-rithms for self-adaptation. In particular, we apply this tech-nique to show the potential benefit of considering adapta-tion tactic latency in proactive adaptation algorithms. Our results show that factoring in tactic latency in decision mak-ing improves the outcome of adaptation. We also present an algorithm to do proactive adaptation that considers tactic latency, and show that it achieves higher utility than an al-gorithm that under the assumption of no latency is optimal.},

abstract = {This work introduces a motion-planning framework for a hybrid system with general continuous dynamics to satisfy a temporal logic specification consisting of co-safety and safety components in a partially unknown environment. The framework employs a multi-layered synergistic planner to generate trajectories that satisfy the specification and adopts an iterative replanning strategy to deal with unknown obstacles. When the discovery of an obstacle renders the specification unsatisfiable, a division between the constraints in the specification is considered. The co-safety component of the specification is treated as a soft constraint, whose partial satisfaction is allowed, while the safety component is viewed as a hard constraint, whose violation is forbidden. To partially satisfy the co-safety component, inspirations 2 are taken from indoor-robotic scenarios, and three types of (unexpressed) restrictions on the ordering of sub-tasks in the specification are considered. For each type, a partial satisfaction method is introduced, which guarantees the generation of trajectories that do not violate the safety constraints while attending to partially satisfying the co-safety requirements with respect to the chosen restriction type. The efficacy of the framework is illustrated through case studies on a hybrid car-like robot in an office environment.},

Opportunistic sensor sharing, e.g., via the Mission-Driven Tasking of Information Producers (MTIP) [1] can greatly im-prove sensor utilization, both decreasing the number of platforms needed to achieve a goal and increasing sensor efficacy. Dynami-cally changing environments, however, are likely to rapidly render any initial plan obsolete. In this paper, we address the challenge of adaptive reallocation of sensor sharing tasks, demonstrating how the adaptable sensor sharing of MTIP can provide significant performance improvements in a large-scale disaster response scenario, as well as identifying areas of inefficiency that are likely to benefit from further improvement.},

abstract = {The global reach and extreme heterogeneity of the Internet of Things present major application development challenges. Using the same Web-based approach underlying the Internet's evolution into the IoT, the Web of Things Testbed provides a stable, open, dynamic, and secure infrastructure to simplify application design and testing. D ue to recent development and innovation in both hardware and software, the global network of networks, or Internet of Things (IoT), is finally becoming a reality. The IoT's diverse billions of communicating devices, or smart objects (SOs), enable a new paradigm of interactivity among all manner of things and people. One of the IoT's biggest hurdles is the monolithic nature and fragmen-tation of existing vertical closed systems, architectures, and application areas. To overcome this, researchers are defining and standardizing interoperability in commu-nication protocols and device mechanisms to allow for more efficient interaction among all IoT components, and Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is emerging as the base network protocol for all IoT applications. 1 To foster IoT development and diffusion, applica-tions are increasingly built around the well-known Web model, bringing about the so-called Web of Things (WoT). The Web-based approach helped to greatly expand the Internet, and will likely have the same effect on the IoT. 2 WoT applications rely on spe-cific Web-oriented application-layer protocols similar to HTTP, such as the Constrained Application Proto-col (CoAP), 3 and, more generally, protocols complying with the Representational State Transfer (REST) archi-tectural style. Design and Deployment of an IoT Application-Oriented Testbed S E P T E M B E R 2 0 1 5 33 Whereas simulation tools typi-cally focus on evaluating lower-layer communication protocols, in recent years several IoT testbeds have been deployed to evaluate IoT solutions in realistic smart environments under real-world conditions. The IoT-Lab 4 is an example of this kind of testbed environment: it provides a very large-scale infrastructure with more than 2,700 wireless sensor nodes spread across six different sites in France, and is used to test protocols at the link and network layers and to collect per-formance results such as energy con-sumption or packet delivery ratio. Although these lower-layer proto-cols have been widely investigated, additional efforts are needed to cre-ate new innovative services, promote long-term evolution of systems, and ensure the robustness of applications against changes that might occur over time—thereby furthering WoT development. To easily build applica-tions for this environment, developers need the ability to work at a high level of abstraction and without worrying about low-level details. Another relevant large-scale IoT testbed is SmartSantander, consist-ing of approximately 20,000 nodes deployed in different cities across Europe. 5},

abstract = {Self-adaptation is emerging as an increasingly impor-tant capability for many applications, particularly those deployed in dynamically changing environments, such as ecosystem monitoring and disaster management. One key challenge posed by Dynamically Adaptive Systems (DASs) is the need to handle changes to the requirements and cor-responding behavior of a DAS in response to varying envi-ronmental conditions. Berry et al. previously identified four levels of RE that should be performed for a DAS. In this pa-per, we propose the Levels of RE for Modeling that reify the original levels to describe RE modeling work done by DAS developers. Specifically, we identify four types of develop-ers: the system developer, the adaptation scenario devel-oper, the adaptation infrastructure developer, and the DAS research community. Each level corresponds to the work of a different type of developer to construct goal model(s) specifying their requirements. We then leverage the Lev-els of RE for Modeling to propose two complementary pro-cesses for performing RE for a DAS. We describe our expe-riences with applying this approach to GridStix, an adap-tive flood warning system, deployed to monitor the River Ribble in Yorkshire, England.},

abstract = {Modern model-driven engineering and Agent-Oriented Soft-ware Engineering (AOSE) methods are rarely utilized in developing robotic software. In this paper, we show how a Model-Driven AOSE methodology can be used for specifying the behavior of multi-robot teams. Specifically, the Agent Systems Engineering Methodology (ASEME) was used for developing the software that realizes the behavior of a physi-cal robot team competing in the Standard Platform League of the RoboCup competition (the robot soccer world cup). The team consists of four humanoid robots, which play soc-cer autonomously in real time utilizing the on-board sensing, processing, and actuating capabilities, while communicating and coordinating with each other in order to achieve their common goal of winning the game. Our work focuses on the challenges of coordinating the base functionalities (object recognition, localization, motion skills) within each robot (intra-agent control) and coordinating the activities of the robots towards a desired team behavior (inter-agent con-trol). We discuss the difficulties we faced and present the solutions we gave to a number of practical issues, which, in our view, are inherent in applying any AOSE methodology to robotics. We demonstrate the added value of using an AOSE methodology in the development of robotic systems, as ASEME allowed for a platform-independent team be-havior specification, automated a large part of the code generation process, and reduced the total development time.},

abstract = {Typically, development of robot behavior entails writing the code, deploying it on a simulator or robot and running it in a test setting. If this feedback reveals errors, the programmer mentally needs to map the error in behavior back to the source code that caused it before being able to fix it. This process suffers from a long cognitive distance between the code and the resulting behavior, which slows down development and can make experimentation with different behaviors prohibitively expensive. In contrast, Live Programming tightens the feedback loop, minimizing the cognitive distance. As a result, programmers benefit from an immediate connection with the program that they are making thanks to an immediate, ???live??? feedback on program behavior. This allows for extremely rapid creation, or variation, of robot behavior and for dramatically increased debugging speed. To enable such Live Robot Programming, in this article we discuss LRP; our language that provides for live programming of nested state machines. We detail the design of the language and show its features, give an overview of the interpreter and how it enables the liveness properties of the language, and illustrate its independence from specific robot APIs.},

abstract = {The work described in this paper is part of the development of a framework to support the joint execution of cooperative missions by a group of robotic vehicles, in a simulated, augmented or real environment. Such framework brings forward the need for formal languages in which to specify the group of vehicles that compose a team; the scenario in which they will operate; and the definition of the mission to be performed (surveillance, pollution detection, search and rescue operations, and so on). This paper presents the Mission Description Language (MDL), a XML dialect that describes the specifics of a mission to be performed by a team of autonomous vehicles. The MDL definition decomposes a mission into a number of possibly dependent phases and uses high-level concepts that facilitate the specification of a mission by both experts and non-experts. The dialect was defined using XML Schema, with all the required information being integrated in the definition. An interface was developed and incorporated into the framework, as to allow for the creation and edition of XML files following the defined schema. Once the information is correctly specified, it can be used in the framework, thus facilitating the process of mission specification and deployment. A survey answered by both practitioners and researchers shows that the degree of satisfaction with MDL is elevated (the overall evaluation of MDL achieved a 3.97 score (out of 5), with 82.05{\%} of the answers being equal to or above 4); also, the usability of the interface was evaluated, having achieved a score of 82.9 in the SUS scale. These results imply that MDL is flexible enough to represent several types of missions, through a user-friendly interface.},

abstract = {CONTEXT
Global Software Development (GSD) presents significant challenges to share and understand knowledge required for developing software. Organizations are expected to implement appropriate practices to address knowledge-sharing challenges in GSD. With the growing literature on GSD and its widespread adoption, it is important to build a body of knowledge to support future research and effective knowledge sharing practices. 

OBJECTIVE
We aimed at systematically identifying and synthesizing knowledge sharing challenges and practices. We also intended to classify the recurrent challenges and most frequently reported practices in different contextual settings. 

METHOD
We used Systematic Literature Review (SLR) for reviewing 61 primary studies that were selected after searching the GSD literature published over the last 14 years (2000–September 2014). We applied thematic analysis method for analysing the data extracted from the reviewed primary studies. 

RESULTS
Our findings revealed that knowledge sharing challenges and practices in GSD could be classified in 6 main themes: management, team structure, work processes/practices, team cognition, social attributes and technology. In regard to contextual settings, we found empirical studies were mainly conducted in an offshore outsourcing collaboration model distributed between two sites. Most of the studied organizations were large enterprises. Many of the studies did not report any information for several contextual attributes that made it difficult to analyse the reported challenges and practices with respect to their respective contexts. 

CONCLUSION
We can conclude: (a) there is a higher tendency among researchers to report practices than challenges of knowledge sharing in GSD. (b) Given our analysis, most of the reported knowledge sharing challenges and practices fall under the theme of “work practices”. (c) The technology related knowledge-sharing challenges are the least reported; we discussed the available technologies for supporting knowledge sharing needs in GSD. (d) The organizational contextual information is missing from a large number of studies; hence, it was not possible to investigate the potential relations between knowledge sharing challenges/practices and the contextual attributes of GSD teams. We assert the need of exploring knowledge sharing in the context of small/medium sized organizations to avoid the risk of findings being biased by specific empirical setting (e.g., large enterprises distributed between US and India).},

In preparation for this traverse, Earth-based tests were performed using Mars weight vehicles. These vehicles were driven over Mars analog bedrock, cohesive soil, and cohesionless sand at various slopes. Vehicle slip was characterized on each of these terrains versus slope for direct upslope driving. Results show that slopes up to 22 degrees are traversable on smooth bedrock and that slopes up to 28 degrees are traversable on some cohesive soils. In cohesionless sand, results show a sharp transition between moderate slip on 10 degree slopes and vehicle embedding at 17 degrees. For cohesionless sand, data are also presented showing the relationship between vehicle slip and wheel sinkage. Side by side testing of the Mars Exploration Rover test vehicle and the Mars Science Laboratory test vehicle show how increased wheel diameter leads to better slope climbing ability in sand for vehicles with nearly identical ground pressure. Lastly, preliminary data from Curiosity's initial driving on Mars are presented and compared to the Earth-based testing, showing good agreement for the driving done during the first 250 Martian days.},

Hence it can be used with small-scale UAVs with limited and different capabilities. The presented system uses a modular architecture and solves the problem by dividing the area between all the robots according to their capabilities. Each aerial robot performs a decomposition based algorithm to create covering paths and a ‘one-to-one' coordination strategy to decide the path segment to patrol.

In this paper, an example problem in this domain is explored and performance results of such a dynamic planning system are presented.

abstract = {As part of our research for the ARL MAST CTA (Collaborative Technology Alliance) [1], we present an integrated architecture that facilitates the design of microautonomous robot platforms and missions, starting from initial design conception to actual deployment. The framework consists of four major components: design tools, mission-specification system (MissionLab), case-based reasoning system (CBR Expert), and a simulation environment (USARSim). The designer begins by using design tools to generate a space of missions, taking broad mission-specific objectives into account. For example, in a multi-robot reconnaissance task, the parameters varied include the number of robots used, mobility capabilities (e.g. maximum speeds), and sensor capabilities. The design tools are used to intelligently carve out the space of all possible parameter combinations to produce a smaller set of mission configurations. Quantitative assessment of this design space is then performed in simulation to determine which particular configuration would yield an effective team before actual deployment. MissionLab, a mission-specification platform, is used to incorporate the input parameters, generate the underlying robot missions, and control the robots in simulation. It also provides logging mechanisms to measure a range of quantitative performance metrics, such as mission completion rates, resource utilization, and time to completion, which are then used to determine the best configuration for a particular mission. These metrics can also provide guidance for the refinement of the entire design process. Finally, a case-based reasoning system allows users to maximize successful deployment of the robots by retrieving proven configurations and determine the robot capabilities necessary for success in a particular mission.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.Most of current modeling languages are based on graphical diagrams. The concrete graphical syntax of these languages typically is defined informally - by text and diagram examples. Only recently, starting from UML 2.5, a formalism is offered for defining the graphical syntax of UML. This formalism is based on Diagram Definition standard by OMG, where the main emphasis is on enabling diagram interchange between different tools implementing the given language. While this is crucial for standardized languages such as UML, this aspect is not so important for domain specific languages. In this paper an approach is offered for simple direct definition of concrete graphical syntax by means of metamodels. Metamodels are typically used for language definition, but mainly the MOF-inspired approach via metametamodel instantiation is used. We offer an alternative approach based on core metamodel specialization, which leads to a more direct and understandable definition, staying at the same meta-layer. In addition, our approach permits a natural extension - a facility for graphical editor definition for the given language, which is vital in the world of DSLs. In contrast to most DSL development platforms which are based on abstract syntax metamodel of the language and a mapping to graphics our facility is based directly on the graphical syntax.},

Such applications impose two basic challenges: (1) the complexity of specifying collaborative behavior and (2) the need for a flexible and lightweight communication infrastructure for mobile robot teams. To address these challenges, we introduce NaoText, a role-based domain-specific language for specifying collaborative robot applications. It contributes dedicated abstractions to conveniently structure and implement collaborative behavior and thus, addresses the complexity challenge. To evaluate NaoText specifications, we introduce an interpreter architecture that is based on (REST) as a lightweight and flexible infrastructure for communication among robot teams. We exemplify the application of NaoText using an illustrative example of robots collaborating in a soccer game and discuss benefits and challenges for our approach compared to state-of-the-art in robot programming. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Their design requires the developers to choose between several variants, which relate to both functionalities and hardware. Some of these choices can be taken at deployment-time, however others should be taken at run-time, when more information about the context is known. To make this possible, a software system needs to be able to reason about its current state and to adapt its architecture to provide the configuration that best suites the context. This paper presents a model-based approach for run-time adaptation of robotic systems. It defines a set of orthogonal models that represent the system architecture, its variability, and the state of the context. Additionally it introduces a set of algorithms that reason about the knowledge represented in our models to resolve the run-time variability and to adapt the system architecture. The paper discusses and evaluates the approach by means of two case studies.},

Typically, these systems attempt to maintain system goals at run time and often provide assurance that they will meet their goals under dynamic and uncertain circumstances. While significant research has focused on ways to engineer selfadaptive capabilities into both new and legacy software systems, less work has been conducted on how to assure that self-adaptation maintains system goals. For traditional, especially safety-critical software systems, assurance techniques decompose assurances into sub-goals and evidence that can be provided by parts of the system. Existing approaches also exist for composing assurances, in terms of composing multiple goals and composing assurances in systems of systems. While some of these techniques may be applied to self-adaptive systems, we argue that several significant challenges remain in applying them to self-adaptive systems in this chapter. We discuss how existing assurance techniques can be applied to composing and decomposing assurances for self-adaptive systems, highlight the challenges in applying them, summarize existing research to address some of these challenges, and identify gaps and opportunities to be addressed by future research.},

abstract = {Modern software-intensive systems often interact with an environment whose behavior changes over time, often unpredictably. The occurrence of changes may jeopardize their ability to meet the desired requirements. It is therefore desirable to design software in a way that it can self-adapt to the occurrence of changes with limited, or even without, human intervention. Self-adaptation can be achieved by bringing software models and model checking to run time, to support perpetual automatic reasoning about changes. Once a change is detected, the system itself can predict if requirements violations may occur and enable appropriate counter-actions. However, existing mainstream model checking techniques and tools were not conceived for run-time usage; hence they hardly meet the constraints imposed by on-the-fly analysis in terms of execution time and memory usage. This paper addresses this issue and focuses on perpetual satisfaction of non-functional requirements, such as reliability or energy consumption. Its main contribution is the description of a mathematical framework for run-time efficient probabilistic model checking. Our approach statically generates a set of verification conditions that can be efficiently evaluated at run time as soon as changes occur. The proposed approach also supports sensitivity analysis, which enables reasoning about the effects of changes and can drive effective adaptation strategies.},

abstract = {Mixed models improve the ability to detect phenotype-genotype associations in the presence of population stratification and multiple levels of relatedness in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), but for large data sets the resource consumption becomes impractical. At the same time, the sample size and number of markers used for GWAS is increasing dramatically, resulting in greater statistical power to detect those associations. The use of mixed models with increasingly large data sets depends on the availability of software for analyzing those models. While multiple software packages implement the mixed model method, no single package provides the best combination of fast computation, ability to handle large samples, flexible modeling and ease of use. Key elements of association analysis with mixed models are reviewed, including modeling phenotype-genotype associations using mixed models, population stratification, kinship and its estimation, variance component estimation, use of best linear unbiased predictors or residuals in place of raw phenotype, improving efficiency and software-user interaction. The available software packages are evaluated, and suggestions made for future software development.},

@article{AugustoGamadeCastroSilva2011,
abstract = {In the past years, the number of autonomous vehicles developed for performing different tasks has increased significantly. Both in military and civilian scenarios, vehicles with an increasing level of autonomy are used to execute missions that take place in a location that is either hazardous or inaccessible for humans. They are also used when it would be impracticable to use vehicles operated by humans, either due to the strain on human resources caused by long-term missions or because it would simply be too costly to use such resources. Many projects have been developed that make use of such vehicles for a variety of purposes. Most of these projects use a limited variety of vehicles and/or are designed to be used for a narrow range of missions. Most of the specifics for each platform are also usually defined in an ad-hoc manner. This dissertation aims at providing an integrated platform for the execution of a wide range of joint missions by a group of heterogeneous robotic vehicles. For that, both a platform and a set of languages that allow for the configuration of a mission have been developed. In a first phase, a general architecture for systems that include autonomous vehicles was designed, taking into consideration several common requirements. This general model was then instantiated into a more specific architecture, where several components interact to allow for the definition and execution of cooperative missions. After designing the platform architecture, and in order to configure all aspects regarding the mission, four XML-based dialects were created – scenario, teams, disturbances and missions. These dialects were categorized as static vs. dynamic and also according to their orientation toward the operating scenario or the team. The Scenario Description Language (SDL) describes the static elements of the scenario in which the mission will take place. The Team Description Language (TDL) describes the composition of the team and some team-specific constraints.The Disturbances Description Language (DDL) describes all (dynamic) elements anomalous to the environment that will constitute targets for the missions.The Mission Description Language (MDL) describes a mission for the team to perform, constituted by a set of phases. Finally, a platform implementing the defined architecture was developed, comprised of several components, including a realistic simulator; a control panel for the operator to specify the mission and related elements; an agent to control traffic in a centralized manner on a localized area; an agent to control each vehicle, responsible, among other things, for mission planning and execution; and some other components. This implementation of the platform and languages allows for a flexible configuration of missions, team and mission scenario. By using a test setting that included a scenario configured with two airports, a team comprised of several aircraft, two simple disturbances and a simple recog- nition mission, several components were tested when working together, in order to validate the approachTests with other vehicle types also proved the feasibility of using this platform with ve- hicles other than aircraft, showing that the approach is valid and the platform can be used with different vehicle types. Also, the platform's modularity and flexibility allows it to be used as a testbed in several new research directions.},

abstract = {Robots are meant to replace humans for a broad variety of everyday tasks such as environmental monitoring or patrolling large public areas for security assurance. The main focus of researchers and practitioners has been on providing tailored software and hardware solutions for very specific and often complex tasks. On one hand, these solutions show great potential and provide advanced capabilities for solving the specific task. On the other hand, the polarized attention to task-specific solutions makes them hard to reuse, customize, and combine. In this paper we propose a family of domain-specific modeling languages for the specification of civilian missions of mobile multi-robot systems. These missions are meant to be described in terms of models that are (i) closer to the general problem domain, (ii) independent from the underlying technologies, (iii) ready to be analyzed, simulated, and executed, and (iv) extensible to new application domains, thus opening up the use of robots to even non-technical operators. Moreover, we show the applicability of the proposed family of languages in two real-world application domains: unmanned multicopters and autonomous underwater vehicles.},

abstract = {Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) is a Software Engineering paradigm that focuses all phases of the software development process in models. Therefore, the automated manipulation of models is essential in MDE. While many Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) exist to specify model transformation, model simulation, or code generation, there is a lack of DSLs to specify and apply model mutations. A model mutation is a kind of model manipulation that creates a set of variants (or mutants) of a seed model by the application of one or more mutation operators. Model mutation has many applications (e.g., model transformation testing, automated generation of exercises, verification of software testing, etc.). The objective of this thesis is the creation of a DSL for model mutation, and its application to different domains like education, model-based testing and search-based software engineering.},

In particular, we present a dedicated catalogue of refactorings for improving the quality of M2M transformations. The refactorings have been explored by analyzing existing transformation examples defined in ATL. However, the refactorings are not specifically tailored to ATL, but applicable also to other M2M transformation languages.},

abstract = {Computer-based sensors and actuators such as global positioning systems, machine vision, and laser-based sensors have progressively been incorporated into mobile robots with the aim of configuring autonomous systems capable of shifting operator activities in agricultural tasks. However, the incorporation of many electronic systems into a robot impairs its reliability and increases its cost. Hardware minimization, as well as software minimization and ease of integration, is essential to obtain feasible robotic systems. A step forward in the application of automatic equipment in agriculture is the use of fleets of robots, in which a number of specialized robots collaborate to accomplish one or several agricultural tasks. This paper strives to develop a system architecture for both individual robots and robots working in fleets to improve reliability, decrease complexity and costs, and permit the integration of software from different developers. Several solutions are studied, from a fully distributed to a whole integrated architecture in which a central computer runs all processes. This work also studies diverse topologies for controlling fleets of robots and advances other prospective topologies. The architecture presented in this paper is being successfully applied in the RHEA fleet, which comprises three ground mobile units based on a commercial tractor chassis.},

People are able to get attached to several objects in our everyday world. However, the relationships we build with regular objects differ significantly from those we may build with socially interactive robots. In contrast to common nonhuman objects, socially interactive robots act autonomously, which increases people's expectations about its capacities. Moreover, human– robot interactions are constructed according to the rules of human–human interaction, inviting users to interact socially with robots. This paper fosters a discussion on the ethical considerations of human–robot relationships and discusses whether these bonds between humans and robots could con-tribute to the good life. Research on people's interactions with and social reactions towards socially interactive robots is necessary to shape the ethical, societal and legal perspec-tives on these issues, and facilitates the design of responsible robotics and the successful introduction of robots into our society.},

@article{Smith2010,
abstract = {In this paper we present a method for automatically generating optimal robot trajectories satisfying high level mission specifications. The motion of the robot in the environment is modeled as a general transition system, enhanced with weighted transitions. The mission is specified by a general linear temporal logic formula. In addition, we require that an optimizing proposition must be repeatedly satisfied. The cost function that we seek to minimize is the maximum time between satisfying instances of the optimizing proposition. For every environment model, and for every formula, our method computes a robot trajectory which minimizes the cost function. The problem is motivated by applications in robotic monitoring and data gathering. In this setting, the optimizing proposition is satisfied at all locations where data can be uploaded, and the entire formula specifies a complex (and infinite horizon) data collection mission. Our method utilizes B$\backslash$"uchi automata to produce an automaton (which can be thought of as a graph) whose runs satisfy the temporal logic specification. We then present a graph algorithm which computes a path corresponding to the optimal robot trajectory. We also present an implementation for a robot performing a data gathering mission in a road network.},
