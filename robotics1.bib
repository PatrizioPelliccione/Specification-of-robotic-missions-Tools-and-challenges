@article{Wagner2015,
abstract = {Planning optimal paths for large numbers of robots is computationally expensive. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for multirobot path planning called subdimensional expansion, which initially plans for each robot individually, and then coordinates motion among the robots as needed. More specifically, subdimensional expansion initially creates a one-dimensional search space embedded in the joint configuration space of the multirobot system. When the search space is found to be blocked during planning by a robot-robot collision, the dimensionality of the search space is locally increased to ensure that an alternative path can be found. As a result, robots are only coordinated when necessary, which reduces the computational cost of finding a path. We present the M∗ algorithm, an implementation of subdimensional expansion that adapts the A∗ planner to perform efficient multirobot planning. M∗ is proven to be complete and to find minimal cost paths. Simulation results are presented that show that M∗ outperforms existing optimal multirobot path planning algorithms.},

@misc{Alonso-Mora2017,
abstract = {In the near future mobile robots, such as personal robots or mobile manipulators, will share the workspace with other robots and humans. We present a method for mission and motion planning that applies to small teams of robots performing a task in an environment with mov-ing obstacles, such as humans. Given a mission specification written in linear temporal logic, such as patrolling a set of Javier Alonso-Mora and Jonathan A. DeCastro have contributed equally to this work. This is one of several papers published in Autonomous Robots com-prising the Special Issue on Online Decision Making in Multi-Robot Coordination. rooms, we synthesize an automaton from which the robots can extract valid strategies. This centralized automaton is executed by the robots in the team at runtime, and in con-junction with a distributed motion planner that guarantees avoidance of moving obstacles. Our contribution is a correct-by-construction synthesis approach to multi-robot mission planning that guarantees collision avoidance with respect to moving obstacles, guarantees satisfaction of the mission specification and resolves encountered deadlocks, where a moving obstacle blocks the robot temporally. Our method provides conditions under which deadlock will be avoided by identifying environment behaviors that, when encountered at runtime, may prevent the robot team from achieving its goals. In particular, (1) it identifies deadlock conditions; (2) it is able to check whether they can be resolved; and (3) the robots implement the deadlock resolution policy locally in a distributed manner. The approach is capable of synthesiz-ing and executing plans even with a high density of dynamic obstacles. In contrast to many existing approaches to mis-sion and motion planning, it is scalable with the number of moving obstacles. We demonstrate the approach in physical experiments with walking humanoids moving in 2D envi-ronments and in simulation with aerial vehicles (quadrotors) navigating in 2D and 3D environments.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer International Publishing AG. The use of robots is gaining considerable traction in several domains, since they are capable of assisting and replacing humans for everyday tasks. To harvest the full potential of robots, it must be possible to define missions for robots that are domain-specific, resilient, and collaborative. Currently, robot vendors provide low-level APIs to program such missions, making mission definition a task-specific and error-prone activity. There is a need for quick definition of new missions, by users that lack programming expertise, such as farmers and emergency workers. In this paper, we extend the existing FLYAQ platform to support the high-level specification of adaptive and highly-resilient missions. We present an extensible specification language that allows users to declaratively specify domain-specific constraints as properties of missions, thus complementing the existing FLYAQ mission language. This permits to move at runtime, the actual generation of low-level operations to satisfy the declaratively specified mission. We show how this specification language can be automatically generated from a domain-specific FLYAQ mission language by using the generative ProMoBox approach. Next, we show how mission goals are achieved taking mission properties into account, and how missions may change due to unexpected circumstances.},

abstract = {Specifying a reactive behavioral configuration for use by a multiagent team requires both a careful choice of the behavior set and the creation of a temporal chain of behaviors which executes the mission. This difficult task is simplified by applying an object-oriented approach to the design of the mission using a construction called an assemblage and a methodology called temporal sequencing. The assemblage construct allows building high level primitives which provide abstractions for the designer. Assemblages consist of groups of basic behaviors and coordination mechanisms that allow the group to be treated as a new coherent behavior. Upon instantiation, the assemblage is parameterized based on the specific mission requirements. Assemblages can be re-parameterized and used in other states within a mission or archived as high level primitives for use in subsequent projects. Temporal sequencing partitions the mission into discrete operating states with perceptual triggers causing transitions between those states. Several smaller independent configurations (assemblages) can then be created which each implement one state. The Societal Agent theory is presented as a basis for constructions of this form. The Configuration Description Language ({\{}CDL){\}} is developed to capture the recursive composition of configurations in an architecture- and robot-independent fashion. The {\{}MissionLab{\}} system, an implementation based on {\{}CDL{\}}, supports the graphical construction of configurations using a visual editor. Various multiagent missions are demonstrated in simulation and on our Denning robots using these tools.},

@article{Park2016,
abstract = {This paper is focused on the development and analysis of suboptimal decision algorithms for a collection of robots that assist a remotely located operator in perimeter surveillance. The operator is tasked with the classification of incursions across the perimeter. whenever there is an incursion into the perimeter, an unattended ground sensor (UGS) in the vicinity, signals an alert. A robot services the alert by visiting the alert location, collecting information, e.g., photo and video imagery, and transmitting it to the operator. The accuracy of operator's classification depends on the volume and freshness of information gathered and provided by the robots at locations where incursions occur. There are two competing objectives for a robot: it needs to spend adequate time at an alert location to collect evidence for aiding the operator in accurate classification but it also needs to service other alerts as soon as possible, so that the evidence collected is relevant. The decision problem is to determine the optimal amount of time a robot must spend servicing an alert. The incursions are stochastic and their statistics are assumed to be known. This problem can be posed as a Markov Decision Problem. However, even for two robots and five UGS locations, the number of states is of the order of billions rendering exact dynamic programming methods intractable. Approximate dynamic programming (ADP) via linear programming (LP) provides a way to approximate the value function and derive suboptimal strategies. The novel feature of this paper is the derivation of a tractable lower bound via LP and the construction of a suboptimal policy whose performance improves upon the lower bound. An illustrative perimeter surveillance example corroborates the results derived in this paper. Note to Practitioners-In practice, one often encounters the curse of dimensionality in the application of dynamic programming to determine optimal policies for controlled Markov chains. This is true, in particular, for dynamic scheduling problems involving multiple robots/servers and queues of tasks that arrive in a stochastic fashion. The computation of value function, critical to the determination of optimal policies, is nearly impractical. Hence, one must settle for suboptimal policies. Two natural questions arise: (1) How does one construct a suboptimal policy? (2) How “good” is the constructed suboptimal policy? A common strategy to tackle the first problem is to approximate the value function and construct a suboptimal policy that is greedy with respect to the approximate value function. Typically, an approximate value function is constructed via a choice of basis functions. The question of how to choose the basis functions systematically for any problem is a difficult one; usually, the structure of the problem at hand is exploited in the construction of basis functions. The same approach is taken here and the state space is partitioned based on the reward structure and the optimal cost-to-go or value function is approximated by a constant over each partition. The second question is related to the first question in the sense that one needs to construct bounds for the performance of a suboptimal policy. In this paper, we construct upper and lower bounds for the value function (optimal performance) and use the lower bound as an approximate value function. Furthermore, we also show that the resulting suboptimal policy comes with a performance guarantee, in that it improves on the lower bound, it was derived from. Literature is replete with techniques for computing upper bounds; however, there is little work on lower bounds, which are also required for bounding the suboptimality of the policy. One encounters prohibitively large number of constraints in the case of computing an upper bound and has to deal with disjunctive linear inequalities in the case of a lower bound. The problem structure is exploited here to circumvent these difficulties. The upper and lower bounds to the value function developed in this paper could also be used to refine the partitions by identifying the partition with the largest difference between the upper and lower bounds; such a partition could be refined further using the structure of the problem. For practitioners, this could be a useful set of tools for generating suboptimal policies for any controlled Markov chain with a reward function that is amenable to state aggregation.},

Safety-critical embedded systems are designed with specific reliability targets, and design practices include the appropriate allocation of both spatial and temporal redundancies in the implementation to meet such requirements. With increasing complexity of such systems and considering the large number of components in such systems, redundancy allocation requires a formal scientific basis. In this work, we profess the analysis of the redundancy requirement upfront with the objective of making it an integral part of the specification. The underlying problem is one of synthesizing a formal specification with built-in redundancy artifacts, from the formal properties of the error-free system, the error probabilities of the control components, and the reliability target. We believe that upfront formal analysis of redundancy requirements is important in budgeting the resource requirements from a cost versus reliability perspective.

abstract = {Traditional formal methods are based on a Boolean satisfaction notion: a reactive system satisfies, or not, a given specification. We generalize formal methods to also address the quality of systems. As an adequate specification formalism we introduce the linear temporal logic LTL[F]. The satisfaction value of an LTL[F] formula is a number between 0 and 1, describing the quality of the satisfaction. The logic generalizes traditional LTL by augmenting it with a (parameterized) set F of arbitrary functions over the interval [0,1]. For example, F may contain the maximum or minimum between the satisfaction values of subformulas, their product, and their average. The classical decision problems in formal methods, such as satisfiability, model checking, and synthesis, are generalized to search and optimization problems in the quantitative setting. For example, model checking asks for the quality in which a specification is satisfied, and synthesis returns a system satisfying the specification with the highest quality. Reasoning about quality gives rise to other natural questions, like the distance between specifications. We formalize these basic questions and study them for LTL[F]. By extending the automata-theoretic approach for LTL to a setting that takes quality into an account, we are able to solve the above problems and show that reasoning about LTL[F] has roughly the same complexity as reasoning about traditional LTL. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Unlike traditional software development methods, agile methods are marked by extensive collaboration, i.e. face-to-face communication. Although claimed to be beneficial, the software development community as a whole is still unfamiliar with the role of the requirements engineering practices in agile methods. The term "agile requirements engineering" is used to define the "agile way" of planning, executing and reasoning about requirements engineering activities. Moreover, not much is known about the challenges posed by collaboration-oriented agile way of dealing with requirements engineering activities. Our goal is to map the evidence available about requirements engineering practices adopted and challenges faced by agile teams in order to understand how traditional requirements engineering issues are resolved using agile requirements engineering. We conducted a systematic review of literature published between 2002 and June 2013 and identified 21 papers, that discuss agile requirements engineering. We formulated and applied specific inclusion and exclusion criteria in two distinct rounds to determine the most relevant studies for our research goal. The review identified 17 practices of agile requirements engineering, five challenges traceable to traditional requirements engineering that were overcome by agile requirements engineering, and eight challenges posed by the practice of agile requirements engineering. However, our findings suggest that agile requirements engineering as a research context needs additional attention and more empirical results are required to better understand the impact of agile requirements engineering practices e.g. dealing with non-functional requirements and self-organising teams.},

abstract = {—The tension between software architecture and agility is not well understood by agile practitioners or re-searchers. If an agile software team spends too little time designing architecture up-front then the team faces increased risk and higher chance of failure; if the team spends too much time the delivery of value to the customer is delayed, and responding to change can become extremely difficult. This paper presents a grounded theory of agile architecture that describes how agile software teams answer the question of how much up-front architecture design effort is enough. This theory, based on grounded theory research involving 44 participants, presents six forces that affect the team's context and five strategies that teams use to help them determine how much effort they should put into up-front design.},

This discrete plan is then implemented by the potential-field-based navigation controllers.

Based on the knowledge update, each agent verifies and revises its motion plan in real time. It is ensured that the hard specification is always fulfilled for safety and the satisfaction for the soft specification is improved gradually. The design is distributed as only local interactions are assumed. The overall framework is demonstrated by a case study and an experiment.},

We show here that, provided that the adversaries follow a deterministic behavior, PDDLplanners can also be used in dynamic environments where uncontrollable adversaries may obstruct paths at some time in the future. Therefore, these environments can be used by mobile robots without the need to use more sophisticated planners where environments are modeled by Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We created a planning API for integrating any PDDLsolver and use it to elaborate platform independent planning behavior. We also have the ability of switching between PDDLsolvers or to change the integration cycle of the planner.

abstract = {— We consider a multiagent system that consists of heterogeneous groups of homogeneous agents. Instead of defining a global task for the whole team, each agent is assigned a local task as syntactically cosafe linear temporal logic formulas that specify both motion and action requirements. Interagent dependence is introduced by collaborative actions, of which the execution requires multiple agents' collaboration. To ensure the satisfaction of all local tasks without central coordination, we propose a bottom–up motion and task coordination strategy that contains an off-line initial plan synthesis and an online coordination scheme based on real-time exchange of request and reply messages. It facilitates not only the collaboration among heterogeneous agents but also the task swapping between homogeneous agents to reduce the total execution cost. It is distributed as any decision is made locally by each agent based on local computation and communication within neighboring agents. It is scalable and resilient to agent failures as the dependence is formed and removed dynamically based on agent capabilities and their plan execution status, instead of preassigned agent identities. The overall scheme is demonstrated by a simulated scenario of 20 agents with loosely coupled local tasks. Note to Practitioners—This paper was motivated by the prob-lem of coordinating a large number of autonomous robots in collaborative manufacturing and delivery processes, where each robot has an individual task but collaborations among the robots are essential for the accomplishment of all tasks. Existing approaches to address such problems rely on the direct composition of all robots' models and tasks, yielding a high complexity of computation and difficulty of coordination, where all robot behaviors are synchronized at all time and coordinated centrally. In this paper, through a local request and reply commu-nication protocol, we remove these constraints and impose only local coordination rules among the robots. Moreover, compared with the common solutions, where interrobot collaborations are bound to preassigned robot identities, we allow the robots to negotiate and choose their collaborators in a flexible way. It is guaranteed that the individual task of each robot is satisfied under the collaboration with other robots, but without the need of a central coordinator. We have shown that it is particularly useful for loosely coupled multirobot applications, where the interrobot collaborations are feasible and local. Simulation results suggest that this approach is applicable to large-scale multirobot systems and can be easily integrated with suitable low-level motion control strategies, but it has not yet been tested in experimental environments. In the future research, we will address more complex robot tasks and practical implementations.},

To get these benefits, it is, however, important that the components are specified and verified to work properly. This work introduces Reusable Automation Components (RACs), which contain not only the implementation details but also a formal specification defining the correct use and behaviour of the component. This formal specification uses temporal logic to describe time-related properties and has a special structure developed to meet industrial control needs. The RAC can be formally verified, to determine whether the implementation fulfils the specification or not. A RAC prototype development tool has been developed to demonstrate this capability. The main difference between the RAC and other frameworks for formal verification of control logic is the specification modeling. In RAC, not only the implementation but also the specification is based on the structure and languages of conventional control logic, aiming at being easy to comprehend for control logic engineers. Several industrial examples are discussed in this paper, showing the benefits and potential of the framework.},

The synthesis method builds upon the construction of an abstract model for the given shared autonomy system from a set of components modeled by Markov decision processes, which are capable of capturing the uncertainty in the operator's performance and response to switching control signals under his different cognitive and physiological states. A cost function is then introduced to quantify the human operator's workload.

These tools, however, typically assume that the robots available for the mission are of the same type (i.e., homogeneous). We loosen this assumption through the integration of contract-net protocol (CNP) based task allocation coupled with a CBR-based mission specification wizard. Two alternative designs are explored for combining case-based mission specification and CNP-based team allocation as well as the tradeoffs that result from the selection of one of these approaches over the other.},

A natural outgrowth of these advances are systems comprised of large numbers of robots that collaborate autonomously in diverse applications. Research on effective au-tonomous control of such systems, commonly called swarms, has increased dramatically in recent years and received attention from many domains, such as bioinspired robotics and control theory. These kinds of distributed systems present novel challenges for the effective integration of human supervisors, operators, and team-mates that are only beginning to be addressed. This paper is the first survey of human–swarm interaction (HSI) and identifies the core concepts needed to design a human–swarm system. We first present the basics of swarm robotics. Then, we introduce HSI from the perspective of a human operator by discussing the cognitive complexity of solving tasks with swarm systems. Next, we introduce the interface between swarm and operator and identify challenges and solutions relating to human–swarm communication, state es-timation and visualization, and human control of swarms. For the latter, we develop a taxonomy of control methods that enable op-erators to control swarms effectively. Finally, we synthesize the results to highlight remaining challenges, unanswered questions, and open problems for HSI, as well as how to address them in future works.

abstract = {Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) promotes the use of models to conduct all phases of software development in an automated way. Models are frequently defined using Domain- Specific Modelling Languages (DSMLs), which many times need to be developed for the domain at hand. However, while constructing DSMLs is a recurring activity in MDE, there is scarce support for gathering, reusing and enacting knowledge for their design and implementation. This forces the development of every new DSML to start from scratch. To alleviate this problem, we propose the construction of DSMLs and their modelling environments aided by patterns which gather knowledge of specific domains, design alternatives, concrete syntax, dynamic semantics and functionality for the modelling environment. They may have associated services, realized via components. Our approach is supported by a tool that enables the construction of DSMLs through the application of patterns, and synthesizes a graphical modelling environment according to them. {\&}copy; 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {Self-adaptive software is capable of evaluating and changing its own behavior, whenever the evaluation shows that the software is not accomplishing what it was intended to do, or when better functionality or performance may be possible. The topic of system adaptivity has been widely studied since the mid-60s and, over the past decade, several application areas and technologies relating to self-adaptivity have assumed greater importance. In all these initiatives, software has become the common element that introduces self-adaptability. Thus, the investigation of systematic software engineering approaches is necessary, in order to develop self-adaptive systems that may ideally be applied across multiple domains. The main goal of this study is to review recent progress on self-adaptivity from the standpoint of computer sciences and cybernetics, based on the analysis of state-of-the-art approaches reported in the literature. This review provides an over-arching, integrated view of computer science and software engineering foundations. Moreover, various methods and techniques currently applied in the design of self-adaptive systems are analyzed, as well as some European research initiatives and projects. Finally, the main bottlenecks for the effective application of self-adaptive technology, as well as a set of key research issues on this topic, are precisely identified, in order to overcome current constraints on the effective application of self-adaptivity in its emerging areas of application. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {UML class diagrams play a central role in modeling activities, and it is essential that class diagrams keep their high quality all along a product life cycle. Correctness problems in class diagrams are mainly caused by complex interactions among class-diagram constraints. Detection, identification, and repair of such problems require background training. In order to improve modelers' capabilities in these directions, we have constructed a catalog of anti-patterns of correctness and quality problems in class diagrams, where an anti-pattern analyzes a typical constraint interaction that causes a correctness or a quality problem and suggests possible repairs. This paper argues that exposure to correctness anti-patterns improves modeling capabilities. The paper introduces the catalog and its pattern language, and describes experiments that test the impact of awareness to modeling problems in class diagrams (via concrete examples and anti-patterns) on the analysis capabilities of modelers. The experiments show that increased awareness implies increased identification. The improvement is remarkably noticed when the awareness is stimulated by anti-patterns, rather than by concrete examples.},

The desired task specifications, which are expressed in a fragment of linear temporal logic (LTL), can capture complex robot behav- iors such as search and rescue, coverage, and collision avoidance. In addition, our framework explicitly captures sensor specifications that depend on the environment with which the robot is interacting, which results in a novel paradigm for sensor-based temporal-logic- motion planning. As one robot is part of the environment of an- other robot, our sensor-based framework very naturally captures multirobot specifications in a decentralized manner. Our compu- tational approach is based on first creating discrete controllers satisfying specific LTL formulas. If feasible, the discrete controller is then used to guide the sensor-based composition of continuous controllers, which results in a hybrid controller satisfying the high- level specification but only if the environment is admissible.},

abstract = {Robots are increasingly used to perform a wide variety of tasks, especially those involving dangerous or inaccessible locations. As the complexity of such tasks grow, robots are being deployed in teams, with complex coordination schemes aimed at maximizing the chance of mission success. Such teams operate under inherently uncertain condi-tions – the robots themselves fail, and have to continuously adapt to changing environmental conditions. A key challenge facing robotic mis-sion designers is therefore to construct a mission – i.e., specify number and type of robots, number and size of teams, coordination and plan-ning mechanisms etc. – so as to maximize some overall utility, such as the probability of mission success. In this paper, we advocate, formal-ize, and empirically justify an approach to compute quantitative utility of robotic missions using probabilistic model checking. We show how to express a robotic demining mission as a restricted type of discrete time Markov chain (called $\alpha$PA), and its utility as either a linear temporal logic formula or a reward. We prove a set of compositionality theorems that enable us to compute the utility of a system composed of several $\alpha$PAs by combining the utilities of each $\alpha$PA in isolation. This ame-liorates the statespace explosion problem, even when the system being verified is composed of a large number of robots. We validate our ap-proach empirically, using the probabilistic model checker prism.},

The objective of this work is to facilitate the nontrivial and error prone task of specifying, correctly and without expertise in temporal logic, temporal properties. In order to understand the basis of a simple but expressive formalism for specifying temporal properties we critically analyze commonly used in practice visual notations.

It uses the notion of waypoints to quickly and efficiently describe the motion plan and enables a variety of complex Linear Temporal Logic specifications to be described succinctly and intuitively by the user without the need for the knowledge and understanding of LTL specification. Thus, it opens avenues for its use by personnel in military, warehouse management, and search and rescue missions.

abstract = {Formal methods offer an effective means to assert the correctness of software systems through mathematical reasoning. However, the need to formulate system properties in a purely mathematical fashion can create pragmatic barriers to the application of these techniques. For this reason, Dwyer et al. invented property specification patterns which is a system of recurring solutions to deal with the temporal intricacies that would make the construction of reactive systems very hard otherwise. Today, property specification patterns provide general rules that help practitioners to qualify order and occurrence, to quantify time bounds, and to express probabilities of events. Nevertheless, a comprehensive framework combining qualitative, real-time, and probabilistic property specification patterns has remained elusive. The benefits of such a framework are twofold. First, it would remove the distinction between qualitative and quantitative aspects of events; and second, it would provide a structure to systematically discover new property specification patterns. In this paper, we report on such a framework and present a unified catalogue that combines all known plus 40 newly identified or extended patterns. We also offer a natural language front-end to map patterns to a temporal logic of choice. To demonstrate the virtue of this new framework, we applied it to a variety of industrial requirements, and use PSPWizard , a tool specifically developed to work with our unified pattern catalogue, to automatically render concrete instances of property specification patterns to formulae of an underlying temporal logic of choice. {\textcopyright} 1976-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Current state-of-the-art robot program development needs expert programmers. Moreover, most robot programs developed today are robot hardware and software specific, and therefore little reusable without modifications. This paper realizes easier robot (re-)programming, by software framework independent models that can be executed using different hard- and software platforms. First, the paper focuses on the formalization of the tasks to be fulfilled by a robot, more specifically constraint-based programming tasks using a Domain Specific Language (DSL). Second, it gives a reference implementation in Lua [1]. The presented DSL makes it easy to develop applications, yet is powerful to execute. It enables automatic model verification and code generation for different hard- and software platforms, diminishing code debugging efforts. Experimental validation shows the ease of creating an application and adapting it, the reduction of the amount of hand-written code, and the debugging aid offered through meaningful errors returned by model verification.},

Addressing this scenario requires combining several components at the planning and execution lev-els. First, the scenario needs to be well modeled in or-der for a planning algorithm to come up with a realistic solution. This implies modeling temporal and spatial synchronization of activities between robots, as well as computing the duration of move activities using a pre-cise terrain model. Then, in order to obtain a robust multi-agent executive layer, we need a robust hierarchi-cal plan scheme that helps identifying appropriate plan repairs when, despite the quality of the various models, failures or delays occur. Finally, we need various algo-rithmic tools in order to obtain flexible plans of good quality.},

abstract = {The broad aim of this interpretive study was to investigate the lived experiences of inter-organisational information system (IOIS) project members who worked in a 3-year-long IOIS project. The study presents an original longitudinal study of project member experiences. In this paper, we have described and analysed one core category, project power, which was derived from a grounded theory (GT) study. This study extends existing theories about power in organisational contexts, in particular the everyday use of power in projects. The paper shows how GT can be used to gain significant insights into a case study, and also generate new concepts. This paper gives detailed insights into the power issues as they played out in a complex IOIS project. This IOIS project spanned four user organisations, two suppliers, one national organisation, a research organisation and a government Ministry. One key finding is that, given the complexity of the project management structures in an IOIS project such as this, project members often resorted to formal authority as a means of getting things done, in the absence of informal links between organisations. The project history also had major ramifications on the use of power in this project.

abstract = {Guidelines for determining nonprobabilistic sample sizes are virtually nonexistent. Purposive samples are the most commonly used form of nonprobabilistic sampling, and their size typically relies on the concept of “saturation,” or the point at which no new information or themes are observed in the data. Although the idea of saturation is helpful at the conceptual level, it provides little practical guidance for estimating sample sizes, prior to data collection, necessary for conducting quality research. Using data from a study involving sixty in-depth interviews with women in two West African countries, the authors systematically document the degree of data saturation and variability over the course of thematic analysis. They operationalize saturation and make evidence-based recommendations regarding nonprobabilistic sample sizes for interviews. Based on the data set, they found that saturation occurred within the first twelve interviews, although basic elements for metathemes were present as early as six interviews. Variability within the data followed similar patterns.},

Trajectory shifts are moments of truth for institutional entrepreneurs, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms of how entrepreneurs reflectively deal with liminality to conceive and bring forth new innovation trajectories.

Introduction to Autonomous Mobile Robots offers students and other interested readers an overview of the technology of mobilitythe mechanisms that allow a mobile robot to move through a real world environment to perform its tasksincluding locomotion, sensing, localization, and motion planning. It discusses all facets of mobile robotics, including hardware design, wheel design, kinematics analysis, sensors and perception, localization, mapping, and robot control architectures.The design of any successful robot involves the integration of many different disciplines, among them kinematics, signal analysis, information theory, artificial intelligence, and probability theory. Reflecting this, the book presents the techniques and technology that enable mobility in a series of interacting modules. Each chapter covers a different aspect of mobility, as the book moves from low-level to high-level details. The first two chapters explore low-level locomotory ability, examining robots' wheels and legs and the principles of kinematics. This is followed by an in-depth view of perception, including descriptions of many "off-the-shelf" sensors and an analysis of the interpretation of sensed data. The final two chapters consider the higher-level challenges of localization and cognition, discussing successful localization strategies, autonomous mapping, and navigation competence. Bringing together all aspects of mobile robotics into one volume, Introduction to Autonomous Mobile Robots can serve as a textbook for coursework or a working tool for beginners in the field.},

abstract = {Empirically based theories are generally perceived as foundational to science. However, in many disciplines, the nature, role and even the necessity of theories remain matters for debate, particularly in young or practical disciplines such as software engineering. This article reports a systematic review of the explicit use of theory in a comprehensive set of 103 articles reporting experiments, from of a total of 5,453 articles published in major software engineering journals and conferences in the decade 1993-2002. Of the 103 articles, 24 use a total of 40 theories in various ways to explain the cause-effect relationship(s) under investigation. The majority of these use theory in the experimental design to justify research questions and hypotheses, some use theory to provide post hoc explanations of their results, and a few test or modify theory. A third of the theories are proposed by authors of the reviewed articles. The interdisciplinary nature of the theories used is greater than that of research in software engineering in general. We found that theory use and awareness of theoretical issues are present, but that theory-driven research is, as yet, not a major issue in empirical software engineering. Several articles comment explicitly on the lack of relevant theory. We call for an increased awareness of the potential benefits of involving theory, when feasible. To support software engineering researchers who wish to use theory, we show which of the reviewed articles on which topics use which theories for what purposes, as well as details of the theories' characteristics},

Such artifacts include—but certainly are not limited to—algorithms (e.g. for information retrieval), human/computer interfaces, and system design methodologies or languages. Design science researchers can be found in many disciplines and fields, notably Engineering and Computer Science; they use a variety of approaches, methods and techniques. In Information Systems, following a number of years of a general shift in IS research away from technological to managerial and organizational issues, an increasing number of observers are calling for a return to an exploration of the "IT" that underlies all IS research (Orlikowski and Iacono, 2001) thus underlining the need for IS design science research.},

This perspective is found to provide a valuable insight into the local and global actor-networks that surround e-Government projects. The mobilisation, interaction and disintegration of these networks underpins the course of such projects, and can itself be understood in relation to network actor power: not through a static conception of power over others but through the dynamic-enacted concept of power to.

The present paper tries to remedy this by introducing an Actor-Network Theory (ANT) inspired approach in which the principle of symmetry is applied to an empirical case. This perspective emphasizes agency as a combination of actions of humans and technology, both separately and in conjunction (a "hybrid"). The research context is a computerized decision support (DSS) for portfolio management in the premium pension system in Sweden. The study shows that a system incorporating humans in conjunction with the DSS (a "hybrid") is able to make advanced economic decisions in line with pension policy by incorporating the preferences and characteristics of humans as well as the capabilities of technology. From a more general perspective, E-Gov is discussed today as a way of extending the hybridization of society, which is becoming an increasingly important component of the state's relationship with its citizens. The paper also discusses methodological implications, most importantly how to represent technology in a symmetrical analysis and how to avoid excessive detail in reporting.},

abstract = {In this article we focus attention on ethnography's place in CSCW by reflecting on how ethnography in the context of CSCW has contributed to our understanding of the sociality and materiality of work and by exploring how the notion of the ‘field site' as a construct in ethnography provides new ways of conceptualizing ‘work' that extends beyond the workplace.We argue that the well known challenges of drawing design implications from ethnographic research have led to useful strategies for tightly coupling ethnography and design. We also offer some thoughts on recent controversies over what constitutes useful and proper ethnographic research in the context of CSCW. Finally, we argue that as the temporal and spatial horizons of inquiry have expanded, along with new domains of collaborative activity, ethnography continues to provide invaluable perspectives.},

Library Trends, 55(1), 171–189. doi:10.1353/lib.2006.0045 (Baker, 2006) Observation as a research method has been called the “bedrock source of human knowledge” by Adler and Adler (1994). Cited as being used by ancient researchers including Aristotle and Auguste Comte, observation has been used for as long as human history has been recorded in an attempt to understand the world. In modern times, observation as a research method has become nebulous in definition. A variety of labels referring to observation as a research method seem to be used interchangeably by researchers including observation, participant observation, and ethnography. Within these broad terms for observation there are several roles a researcher may take depending on the study ranging from nonparticipation to complete membership in the group being studied. Nonparticipation is at one end of the continuum of roles a researcher may play in observation as a research method. In this role, the researcher has no involvement with the participants of the research. The researcher may analyze data about people or watch groups and individuals via camera. The individuals being observed may or may not be aware of the researcher. Slightly more involved with the participants than the non-participatory researcher is the complete observer. In this role, the researcher is present with the individuals being studied, but takes special care to detach from the group. This role is limited in value due to lack of access to ‘insider' information. It is, however, a good starting point to collect baseline data on a group. An observer as participant is still primarily a researcher and so maintains a certain detachment from the group, but interacts with participants through interviews and conversations. In this role, the participants are aware of the researcher's presence in the group. More popular with qualitative researchers is the role of moderate or peripheral membership. This role involves a balance between insider and outsider. The researcher limits their involvement so as not to influence the specific activities being studied. In some cases, it is advantageous for the researcher to gain active membership in the group. In this role, the researcher participates in the activities of the group and even develops relationships with group members. This can be necessary when the researcher needs to understand intimate information or intricate details of an activity. Finally, complete participation is at the complete opposite end of the continuum from nonparticipation. In this role, the researcher acts as a member and not primarily as a researcher. This role gives the researcher a thorough and intimate understanding of the group, but can become too involved to remain objective. Adler, P. A., {\&} Adler, P. (1994). Observational techniques.

In this traditional model of ethnography, one of the most important data-gathering techniques is participant observation. The ethnographer observes and participates but does not actively seek to change the situation. In recent years, however, a new type of ethnographic research has emerged – one that can be called design ethnography. Design ethnography is where the researcher goes beyond observation and actively engages with people in the field. Our view is that design ethnography has much potential for research in information systems. It is a new form of engaged scholarship that bridges the gap between ethnographic research and design science research.},

In my own areas of research -- human-computer interaction and computer- supported co-operative work, it has transformed thinking about the role of users in the software development process. However, participatory design refers to a high-level feature of design methods that can be implemented in myriad ways. It is not a single and integral design method. In this paper, I discuss several dimensions of possible implementations of participatory design: domains of human activity — roles of stakeholders in a design, types of shared design representations, the scope and duration of participatory interactions, and the relationship of users to design activity with respect to changes in their knowledge and skill. I believe these dimensions},

abstract = {Due to a general shift in manufacturing paradigm from mass production towards mass customization, reconfigurable automation technologies, such as robots, are required. However, current industrial robot solutions are notoriously difficult to program, leading to high changeover times when new products are introduced by manufacturers. In order to compete on global markets, the factories of tomorrow need complete production lines, including automation technologies that can effortlessly be reconfigured or repurposed, when the need arises. In this paper we present the concept of general, self-asserting robot skills for manufacturing. We show how a relatively small set of skills are derived from current factory worker instructions, and how these can be transferred to industrial mobile manipulators. General robot skills can not only be implemented on these robots, but also be intuitively concatenated to program the robots to perform a variety of tasks, through the use of simple task-level programming methods. We demonstrate various approaches to this, extensively tested with several people inexperienced in robotics. We validate our findings through several deployments of the complete robot system in running production facilities at an industrial partner. It follows from these experiments that the use of robot skills, and associated task-level programming framework, is a viable solution to introducing robots that can intuitively and on the fly be programmed to perform new tasks by factory workers.},

Changes and evolution of a robot or world have an invasive and often unpredictable impact on the application software. We propose making the models of robots and worlds explicit in robotics applications and separate these by introducing application-specific and platform-independent interfaces. This separation allows modular model-driven development of robotics applications and enables the reuse and adaptation of models and applications without need for invasive modifications. We present a framework with a family of modeling languages for conceptual, platform-independent applications, tasks, robots, and worlds. The model-driven RoboTask framework integrates these languages with a runtime architecture to execute robotics tasks using a planner and mappings from conceptual models to actual platforms. This enables a separation of domain concerns from software development concerns and modification of applications without invasive impacts on their separated constituents. We believe that the enabled reuse and adaptation lead to more efficient development and higher quality software for robotics applications.},

abstract = {Although different approaches to decision-making in self-adaptive systems have shown their effectiveness in the past by factoring in predictions about the system and its environ-ment (e.g., resource availability), no proposal considers the latency associated with the execution of tactics upon the tar-get system. However, different adaptation tactics can take different amounts of time until their effects can be observed. In reactive adaptation, ignoring adaptation tactic latency can lead to suboptimal adaptation decisions (e.g., activat-ing a server that takes more time to boot than the transient spike in traffic that triggered its activation). In proactive adaptation, taking adaptation latency into account is nec-essary to get the system into the desired state to deal with an upcoming situation. In this paper, we introduce a for-mal analysis technique based on model checking of stochas-tic multiplayer games (SMGs) that enables us to quantify the potential benefits of employing different types of algo-rithms for self-adaptation. In particular, we apply this tech-nique to show the potential benefit of considering adapta-tion tactic latency in proactive adaptation algorithms. Our results show that factoring in tactic latency in decision mak-ing improves the outcome of adaptation. We also present an algorithm to do proactive adaptation that considers tactic latency, and show that it achieves higher utility than an al-gorithm that under the assumption of no latency is optimal.},

abstract = {This work introduces a motion-planning framework for a hybrid system with general continuous dynamics to satisfy a temporal logic specification consisting of co-safety and safety components in a partially unknown environment. The framework employs a multi-layered synergistic planner to generate trajectories that satisfy the specification and adopts an iterative replanning strategy to deal with unknown obstacles. When the discovery of an obstacle renders the specification unsatisfiable, a division between the constraints in the specification is considered. The co-safety component of the specification is treated as a soft constraint, whose partial satisfaction is allowed, while the safety component is viewed as a hard constraint, whose violation is forbidden. To partially satisfy the co-safety component, inspirations 2 are taken from indoor-robotic scenarios, and three types of (unexpressed) restrictions on the ordering of sub-tasks in the specification are considered. For each type, a partial satisfaction method is introduced, which guarantees the generation of trajectories that do not violate the safety constraints while attending to partially satisfying the co-safety requirements with respect to the chosen restriction type. The efficacy of the framework is illustrated through case studies on a hybrid car-like robot in an office environment.},

Using the same Web-based approach underlying the Internet's evolution into the IoT, the Web of Things Testbed provides a stable, open, dynamic, and secure infrastructure to simplify application design and testing. D ue to recent development and innovation in both hardware and software, the global network of networks, or Internet of Things (IoT), is finally becoming a reality. The IoT's diverse billions of communicating devices, or smart objects (SOs), enable a new paradigm of interactivity among all manner of things and people. One of the IoT's biggest hurdles is the monolithic nature and fragmen-tation of existing vertical closed systems, architectures, and application areas. To overcome this, researchers are defining and standardizing interoperability in commu-nication protocols and device mechanisms to allow for more efficient interaction among all IoT components, and Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is emerging as the base network protocol for all IoT applications. 1 To foster IoT development and diffusion, applica-tions are increasingly built around the well-known Web model, bringing about the so-called Web of Things (WoT). The Web-based approach helped to greatly expand the Internet, and will likely have the same effect on the IoT. 2 WoT applications rely on spe-cific Web-oriented application-layer protocols similar to HTTP, such as the Constrained Application Proto-col (CoAP), 3 and, more generally, protocols complying with the Representational State Transfer (REST) archi-tectural style. Design and Deployment of an IoT Application-Oriented Testbed S E P T E M B E R 2 0 1 5 33 Whereas simulation tools typi-cally focus on evaluating lower-layer communication protocols, in recent years several IoT testbeds have been deployed to evaluate IoT solutions in realistic smart environments under real-world conditions. The IoT-Lab 4 is an example of this kind of testbed environment: it provides a very large-scale infrastructure with more than 2,700 wireless sensor nodes spread across six different sites in France, and is used to test protocols at the link and network layers and to collect per-formance results such as energy con-sumption or packet delivery ratio. Although these lower-layer proto-cols have been widely investigated, additional efforts are needed to cre-ate new innovative services, promote long-term evolution of systems, and ensure the robustness of applications against changes that might occur over time—thereby furthering WoT development. To easily build applica-tions for this environment, developers need the ability to work at a high level of abstraction and without worrying about low-level details. Another relevant large-scale IoT testbed is SmartSantander, consist-ing of approximately 20,000 nodes deployed in different cities across Europe. 5},

abstract = {Self-adaptation is emerging as an increasingly impor-tant capability for many applications, particularly those deployed in dynamically changing environments, such as ecosystem monitoring and disaster management. One key challenge posed by Dynamically Adaptive Systems (DASs) is the need to handle changes to the requirements and cor-responding behavior of a DAS in response to varying envi-ronmental conditions. Berry et al. previously identified four levels of RE that should be performed for a DAS. In this pa-per, we propose the Levels of RE for Modeling that reify the original levels to describe RE modeling work done by DAS developers. Specifically, we identify four types of develop-ers: the system developer, the adaptation scenario devel-oper, the adaptation infrastructure developer, and the DAS research community. Each level corresponds to the work of a different type of developer to construct goal model(s) specifying their requirements. We then leverage the Lev-els of RE for Modeling to propose two complementary pro-cesses for performing RE for a DAS. We describe our expe-riences with applying this approach to GridStix, an adap-tive flood warning system, deployed to monitor the River Ribble in Yorkshire, England.},

abstract = {Modern model-driven engineering and Agent-Oriented Soft-ware Engineering (AOSE) methods are rarely utilized in developing robotic software. In this paper, we show how a Model-Driven AOSE methodology can be used for specifying the behavior of multi-robot teams. Specifically, the Agent Systems Engineering Methodology (ASEME) was used for developing the software that realizes the behavior of a physi-cal robot team competing in the Standard Platform League of the RoboCup competition (the robot soccer world cup). The team consists of four humanoid robots, which play soc-cer autonomously in real time utilizing the on-board sensing, processing, and actuating capabilities, while communicating and coordinating with each other in order to achieve their common goal of winning the game. Our work focuses on the challenges of coordinating the base functionalities (object recognition, localization, motion skills) within each robot (intra-agent control) and coordinating the activities of the robots towards a desired team behavior (inter-agent con-trol). We discuss the difficulties we faced and present the solutions we gave to a number of practical issues, which, in our view, are inherent in applying any AOSE methodology to robotics. We demonstrate the added value of using an AOSE methodology in the development of robotic systems, as ASEME allowed for a platform-independent team be-havior specification, automated a large part of the code generation process, and reduced the total development time.},

abstract = {Typically, development of robot behavior entails writing the code, deploying it on a simulator or robot and running it in a test setting. If this feedback reveals errors, the programmer mentally needs to map the error in behavior back to the source code that caused it before being able to fix it. This process suffers from a long cognitive distance between the code and the resulting behavior, which slows down development and can make experimentation with different behaviors prohibitively expensive. In contrast, Live Programming tightens the feedback loop, minimizing the cognitive distance. As a result, programmers benefit from an immediate connection with the program that they are making thanks to an immediate, ???live??? feedback on program behavior. This allows for extremely rapid creation, or variation, of robot behavior and for dramatically increased debugging speed. To enable such Live Robot Programming, in this article we discuss LRP; our language that provides for live programming of nested state machines. We detail the design of the language and show its features, give an overview of the interpreter and how it enables the liveness properties of the language, and illustrate its independence from specific robot APIs.},

UAVs in a team need to operate in sub-groups or independently to perform specific tasks, but still synchronise state information regularly and cope with intermit-tent communication failures as well as permanent UAV failures. This paper describes a failure management scheme that copes with failures, which may result in disjoint sub-networks within the team. A commu-nication management protocol is proposed to control UAVs performing disconnected individual operations, while maintaining the team's struc-ture by trying to ensure that all members of the mission rendezvous to communicate at intermittent intervals.

abstract = {The work described in this paper is part of the development of a framework to support the joint execution of cooperative missions by a group of robotic vehicles, in a simulated, augmented or real environment. Such framework brings forward the need for formal languages in which to specify the group of vehicles that compose a team; the scenario in which they will operate; and the definition of the mission to be performed (surveillance, pollution detection, search and rescue operations, and so on). This paper presents the Mission Description Language (MDL), a XML dialect that describes the specifics of a mission to be performed by a team of autonomous vehicles. The MDL definition decomposes a mission into a number of possibly dependent phases and uses high-level concepts that facilitate the specification of a mission by both experts and non-experts. The dialect was defined using XML Schema, with all the required information being integrated in the definition. An interface was developed and incorporated into the framework, as to allow for the creation and edition of XML files following the defined schema. Once the information is correctly specified, it can be used in the framework, thus facilitating the process of mission specification and deployment. A survey answered by both practitioners and researchers shows that the degree of satisfaction with MDL is elevated (the overall evaluation of MDL achieved a 3.97 score (out of 5), with 82.05{\%} of the answers being equal to or above 4); also, the usability of the interface was evaluated, having achieved a score of 82.9 in the SUS scale. These results imply that MDL is flexible enough to represent several types of missions, through a user-friendly interface.},

abstract = {CONTEXT
Global Software Development (GSD) presents significant challenges to share and understand knowledge required for developing software. Organizations are expected to implement appropriate practices to address knowledge-sharing challenges in GSD. With the growing literature on GSD and its widespread adoption, it is important to build a body of knowledge to support future research and effective knowledge sharing practices. 

OBJECTIVE
We aimed at systematically identifying and synthesizing knowledge sharing challenges and practices. We also intended to classify the recurrent challenges and most frequently reported practices in different contextual settings. 

METHOD
We used Systematic Literature Review (SLR) for reviewing 61 primary studies that were selected after searching the GSD literature published over the last 14 years (2000–September 2014). We applied thematic analysis method for analysing the data extracted from the reviewed primary studies. 

RESULTS
Our findings revealed that knowledge sharing challenges and practices in GSD could be classified in 6 main themes: management, team structure, work processes/practices, team cognition, social attributes and technology. In regard to contextual settings, we found empirical studies were mainly conducted in an offshore outsourcing collaboration model distributed between two sites. Most of the studied organizations were large enterprises. Many of the studies did not report any information for several contextual attributes that made it difficult to analyse the reported challenges and practices with respect to their respective contexts. 

CONCLUSION
We can conclude: (a) there is a higher tendency among researchers to report practices than challenges of knowledge sharing in GSD. (b) Given our analysis, most of the reported knowledge sharing challenges and practices fall under the theme of “work practices”. (c) The technology related knowledge-sharing challenges are the least reported; we discussed the available technologies for supporting knowledge sharing needs in GSD. (d) The organizational contextual information is missing from a large number of studies; hence, it was not possible to investigate the potential relations between knowledge sharing challenges/practices and the contextual attributes of GSD teams. We assert the need of exploring knowledge sharing in the context of small/medium sized organizations to avoid the risk of findings being biased by specific empirical setting (e.g., large enterprises distributed between US and India).},

Vehicle slip was characterized on each of these terrains versus slope for direct upslope driving. Results show that slopes up to 22 degrees are traversable on smooth bedrock and that slopes up to 28 degrees are traversable on some cohesive soils. In cohesionless sand, results show a sharp transition between moderate slip on 10 degree slopes and vehicle embedding at 17 degrees. For cohesionless sand, data are also presented showing the relationship between vehicle slip and wheel sinkage. Side by side testing of the Mars Exploration Rover test vehicle and the Mars Science Laboratory test vehicle show how increased wheel diameter leads to better slope climbing ability in sand for vehicles with nearly identical ground pressure. Lastly, preliminary data from Curiosity's initial driving on Mars are presented and compared to the Earth-based testing, showing good agreement for the driving done during the first 250 Martian days.},

This paper proposes a distributed approach to coordinate a team of heterogeneous UAVs cooperating efficiently in patrolling missions around irregular areas, with low communication ranges and memory storage requirements. Hence it can be used with small-scale UAVs with limited and different capabilities. The presented system uses a modular architecture and solves the problem by dividing the area between all the robots according to their capabilities. Each aerial robot performs a decomposition based algorithm to create covering paths and a ‘one-to-one' coordination strategy to decide the path segment to patrol. The system is decentralized and fault-tolerant. It ensures a finite time to share information between all the robots and guarantees convergence to the desired steady state, based on the maximal minimum frequency criteria. A set of simulat...},

In this paper, an example problem in this domain is explored and performance results of such a dynamic planning system are presented. The system was able to dynamically optimize the motion of 3 robots toward 6 goals in real time, improving the average overall mission performance compared to a static planner by 25{\%}.

@article{Kira2010,
abstract = {As part of our research for the ARL MAST CTA (Collaborative Technology Alliance) [1], we present an integrated architecture that facilitates the design of microautonomous robot platforms and missions, starting from initial design conception to actual deployment. The framework consists of four major components: design tools, mission-specification system (MissionLab), case-based reasoning system (CBR Expert), and a simulation environment (USARSim). The designer begins by using design tools to generate a space of missions, taking broad mission-specific objectives into account. For example, in a multi-robot reconnaissance task, the parameters varied include the number of robots used, mobility capabilities (e.g. maximum speeds), and sensor capabilities. The design tools are used to intelligently carve out the space of all possible parameter combinations to produce a smaller set of mission configurations. Quantitative assessment of this design space is then performed in simulation to determine which particular configuration would yield an effective team before actual deployment. MissionLab, a mission-specification platform, is used to incorporate the input parameters, generate the underlying robot missions, and control the robots in simulation. It also provides logging mechanisms to measure a range of quantitative performance metrics, such as mission completion rates, resource utilization, and time to completion, which are then used to determine the best configuration for a particular mission. These metrics can also provide guidance for the refinement of the entire design process. Finally, a case-based reasoning system allows users to maximize successful deployment of the robots by retrieving proven configurations and determine the robot capabilities necessary for success in a particular mission.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.Most of current modeling languages are based on graphical diagrams. The concrete graphical syntax of these languages typically is defined informally - by text and diagram examples. Only recently, starting from UML 2.5, a formalism is offered for defining the graphical syntax of UML. This formalism is based on Diagram Definition standard by OMG, where the main emphasis is on enabling diagram interchange between different tools implementing the given language. While this is crucial for standardized languages such as UML, this aspect is not so important for domain specific languages. In this paper an approach is offered for simple direct definition of concrete graphical syntax by means of metamodels. Metamodels are typically used for language definition, but mainly the MOF-inspired approach via metametamodel instantiation is used. We offer an alternative approach based on core metamodel specialization, which leads to a more direct and understandable definition, staying at the same meta-layer. In addition, our approach permits a natural extension - a facility for graphical editor definition for the given language, which is vital in the world of DSLs. In contrast to most DSL development platforms which are based on abstract syntax metamodel of the language and a mapping to graphics our facility is based directly on the graphical syntax.},

abstract = {The recent progress in robotic hard- and software motivates novel, collaborative robot applications, where multiple robots jointly accomplish complex tasks like surveillance or rescue scenarios. Such applications impose two basic challenges: (1) the complexity of specifying collaborative behavior and (2) the need for a flexible and lightweight communication infrastructure for mobile robot teams. To address these challenges, we introduce NaoText, a role-based domain-specific language for specifying collaborative robot applications. It contributes dedicated abstractions to conveniently structure and implement collaborative behavior and thus, addresses the complexity challenge. To evaluate NaoText specifications, we introduce an interpreter architecture that is based on (REST) as a lightweight and flexible infrastructure for communication among robot teams. We exemplify the application of NaoText using an illustrative example of robots collaborating in a soccer game and discuss benefits and challenges for our approach compared to state-of-the-art in robot programming. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Robotics applications are characterized by a huge amount of variability. Their design requires the developers to choose between several variants, which relate to both functionalities and hardware. Some of these choices can be taken at deployment-time, however others should be taken at run-time, when more information about the context is known. To make this possible, a software system needs to be able to reason about its current state and to adapt its architecture to provide the configuration that best suites the context. This paper presents a model-based approach for run-time adaptation of robotic systems. It defines a set of orthogonal models that represent the system architecture, its variability, and the state of the context. Additionally it introduces a set of algorithms that reason about the knowledge represented in our models to resolve the run-time variability and to adapt the system architecture. The paper discusses and evaluates the approach by means of two case studies.},

Much as RRA approach can enable robots to adapt models at run time, the configurations are made by an expert programmer, but not domain expert declaratively.},

Typically, these systems attempt to maintain system goals at run time and often provide assurance that they will meet their goals under dynamic and uncertain circumstances. While significant research has focused on ways to engineer selfadaptive capabilities into both new and legacy software systems, less work has been conducted on how to assure that self-adaptation maintains system goals. For traditional, especially safety-critical software systems, assurance techniques decompose assurances into sub-goals and evidence that can be provided by parts of the system. Existing approaches also exist for composing assurances, in terms of composing multiple goals and composing assurances in systems of systems. While some of these techniques may be applied to self-adaptive systems, we argue that several significant challenges remain in applying them to self-adaptive systems in this chapter. We discuss how existing assurance techniques can be applied to composing and decomposing assurances for self-adaptive systems, highlight the challenges in applying them, summarize existing research to address some of these challenges, and identify gaps and opportunities to be addressed by future research.},

abstract = {Modern software-intensive systems often interact with an environment whose behavior changes over time, often unpredictably. The occurrence of changes may jeopardize their ability to meet the desired requirements. It is therefore desirable to design software in a way that it can self-adapt to the occurrence of changes with limited, or even without, human intervention. Self-adaptation can be achieved by bringing software models and model checking to run time, to support perpetual automatic reasoning about changes. Once a change is detected, the system itself can predict if requirements violations may occur and enable appropriate counter-actions. However, existing mainstream model checking techniques and tools were not conceived for run-time usage; hence they hardly meet the constraints imposed by on-the-fly analysis in terms of execution time and memory usage. This paper addresses this issue and focuses on perpetual satisfaction of non-functional requirements, such as reliability or energy consumption. Its main contribution is the description of a mathematical framework for run-time efficient probabilistic model checking. Our approach statically generates a set of verification conditions that can be efficiently evaluated at run time as soon as changes occur. The proposed approach also supports sensitivity analysis, which enables reasoning about the effects of changes and can drive effective adaptation strategies.},

At the same time, the sample size and number of markers used for GWAS is increasing dramatically, resulting in greater statistical power to detect those associations. The use of mixed models with increasingly large data sets depends on the availability of software for analyzing those models. While multiple software packages implement the mixed model method, no single package provides the best combination of fast computation, ability to handle large samples, flexible modeling and ease of use. Key elements of association analysis with mixed models are reviewed, including modeling phenotype-genotype associations using mixed models, population stratification, kinship and its estimation, variance component estimation, use of best linear unbiased predictors or residuals in place of raw phenotype, improving efficiency and software-user interaction.

@article{AugustoGamadeCastroSilva2011,
abstract = {In the past years, the number of autonomous vehicles developed for performing different tasks has increased significantly. Both in military and civilian scenarios, vehicles with an increasing level of autonomy are used to execute missions that take place in a location that is either hazardous or inaccessible for humans. They are also used when it would be impracticable to use vehicles operated by humans, either due to the strain on human resources caused by long-term missions or because it would simply be too costly to use such resources. Many projects have been developed that make use of such vehicles for a variety of purposes. Most of these projects use a limited variety of vehicles and/or are designed to be used for a narrow range of missions. Most of the specifics for each platform are also usually defined in an ad-hoc manner. This dissertation aims at providing an integrated platform for the execution of a wide range of joint missions by a group of heterogeneous robotic vehicles. For that, both a platform and a set of languages that allow for the configuration of a mission have been developed. In a first phase, a general architecture for systems that include autonomous vehicles was designed, taking into consideration several common requirements. This general model was then instantiated into a more specific architecture, where several components interact to allow for the definition and execution of cooperative missions. After designing the platform architecture, and in order to configure all aspects regarding the mission, four XML-based dialects were created – scenario, teams, disturbances and missions. These dialects were categorized as static vs. dynamic and also according to their orientation toward the operating scenario or the team. The Scenario Description Language (SDL) describes the static elements of the scenario in which the mission will take place. The Team Description Language (TDL) describes the composition of the team and some team-specific constraints.The Disturbances Description Language (DDL) describes all (dynamic) elements anomalous to the environment that will constitute targets for the missions.The Mission Description Language (MDL) describes a mission for the team to perform, constituted by a set of phases. Finally, a platform implementing the defined architecture was developed, comprised of several components, including a realistic simulator; a control panel for the operator to specify the mission and related elements; an agent to control traffic in a centralized manner on a localized area; an agent to control each vehicle, responsible, among other things, for mission planning and execution; and some other components. This implementation of the platform and languages allows for a flexible configuration of missions, team and mission scenario. By using a test setting that included a scenario configured with two airports, a team comprised of several aircraft, two simple disturbances and a simple recog- nition mission, several components were tested when working together, in order to validate the approachTests with other vehicle types also proved the feasibility of using this platform with ve- hicles other than aircraft, showing that the approach is valid and the platform can be used with different vehicle types. Also, the platform's modularity and flexibility allows it to be used as a testbed in several new research directions.},

abstract = {Robots are meant to replace humans for a broad variety of everyday tasks such as environmental monitoring or patrolling large public areas for security assurance. The main focus of researchers and practitioners has been on providing tailored software and hardware solutions for very specific and often complex tasks. On one hand, these solutions show great potential and provide advanced capabilities for solving the specific task. On the other hand, the polarized attention to task-specific solutions makes them hard to reuse, customize, and combine. In this paper we propose a family of domain-specific modeling languages for the specification of civilian missions of mobile multi-robot systems. These missions are meant to be described in terms of models that are (i) closer to the general problem domain, (ii) independent from the underlying technologies, (iii) ready to be analyzed, simulated, and executed, and (iv) extensible to new application domains, thus opening up the use of robots to even non-technical operators. Moreover, we show the applicability of the proposed family of languages in two real-world application domains: unmanned multicopters and autonomous underwater vehicles.},

abstract = {Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) is a Software Engineering paradigm that focuses all phases of the software development process in models. Therefore, the automated manipulation of models is essential in MDE. While many Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) exist to specify model transformation, model simulation, or code generation, there is a lack of DSLs to specify and apply model mutations. A model mutation is a kind of model manipulation that creates a set of variants (or mutants) of a seed model by the application of one or more mutation operators. Model mutation has many applications (e.g., model transformation testing, automated generation of exercises, verification of software testing, etc.). The objective of this thesis is the creation of a DSL for model mutation, and its application to different domains like education, model-based testing and search-based software engineering.},

Unfortunately, in the field of model transformations, such refac-toring support is so far missing. This paper tackles this limitation by adapting the notion of refactorings to model-to-model (M2M) transfor-mations. In particular, we present a dedicated catalogue of refactorings for improving the quality of M2M transformations. The refactorings have been explored by analyzing existing transformation examples defined in ATL. However, the refactorings are not specifically tailored to ATL, but applicable also to other M2M transformation languages.},

abstract = {Computer-based sensors and actuators such as global positioning systems, machine vision, and laser-based sensors have progressively been incorporated into mobile robots with the aim of configuring autonomous systems capable of shifting operator activities in agricultural tasks. However, the incorporation of many electronic systems into a robot impairs its reliability and increases its cost. Hardware minimization, as well as software minimization and ease of integration, is essential to obtain feasible robotic systems. A step forward in the application of automatic equipment in agriculture is the use of fleets of robots, in which a number of specialized robots collaborate to accomplish one or several agricultural tasks. This paper strives to develop a system architecture for both individual robots and robots working in fleets to improve reliability, decrease complexity and costs, and permit the integration of software from different developers. Several solutions are studied, from a fully distributed to a whole integrated architecture in which a central computer runs all processes. This work also studies diverse topologies for controlling fleets of robots and advances other prospective topologies. The architecture presented in this paper is being successfully applied in the RHEA fleet, which comprises three ground mobile units based on a commercial tractor chassis.},

abstract = {When people interact with socially interactive robots on a regular basis, it could be that people start devel-oping some kind of relationship with such robots. People are able to get attached to several objects in our everyday world. However, the relationships we build with regular objects differ significantly from those we may build with socially interactive robots. In contrast to common nonhuman objects, socially interactive robots act autonomously, which increases people's expectations about its capacities. Moreover, human– robot interactions are constructed according to the rules of human–human interaction, inviting users to interact socially with robots. This paper fosters a discussion on the ethical considerations of human–robot relationships and discusses whether these bonds between humans and robots could con-tribute to the good life. Research on people's interactions with and social reactions towards socially interactive robots is necessary to shape the ethical, societal and legal perspec-tives on these issues, and facilitates the design of responsible robotics and the successful introduction of robots into our society.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a method for automatically generating optimal robot trajectories satisfying high level mission specifications. The motion of the robot in the environment is modeled as a general transition system, enhanced with weighted transitions. The mission is specified by a general linear temporal logic formula. In addition, we require that an optimizing proposition must be repeatedly satisfied. The cost function that we seek to minimize is the maximum time between satisfying instances of the optimizing proposition. For every environment model, and for every formula, our method computes a robot trajectory which minimizes the cost function. The problem is motivated by applications in robotic monitoring and data gathering. In this setting, the optimizing proposition is satisfied at all locations where data can be uploaded, and the entire formula specifies a complex (and infinite horizon) data collection mission. Our method utilizes B$\backslash$"uchi automata to produce an automaton (which can be thought of as a graph) whose runs satisfy the temporal logic specification. We then present a graph algorithm which computes a path corresponding to the optimal robot trajectory. We also present an implementation for a robot performing a data gathering mission in a road network.},
