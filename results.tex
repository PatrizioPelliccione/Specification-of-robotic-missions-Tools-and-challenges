\section{Analysis of Environments - RQ2}

\Figref{fig:featuremodel} shows the general structure of the features we identified in our environments. 
We classified the key, top-level features into (\secref{sec:envfeatures}) capabilities and characteristics of the environments, represented by the features \feditor, \fsimulator, \fdebugging, \fspectime, \fdeployment, and \fmultilang, and into (\secref{sec:langcharacteristics}) general language characteristics, represented by the feature \flanguage; and into (\secref{sec:langconcepts}) the actual concepts the languages offer to specify missions, represented by the feature \flangconcepts.
%\claudio{
%How many features have been identified in total? How many optional etc?
%How many features were identified in he brainstorming meeting? How many features were extracted from other sources?}
%\claudio{What is a general language feature? what is a Language concept?}
%\claudio{What are you going to discuss in the next two sections?}
