\section{Contribution}
The contribution of this study would be to
\begin{itemize}
    \item Understand the challenges of specifying missions by user domain experts and robotic engineers
    \item Recommend best approach to mitigate the challenges during specifications
    \item Come up with aspects to classify mission specifications. This will help in facilitating development of more expressive and declarative specification language for users.
    %\item Identify opportunities for future research work.
\end{itemize}
